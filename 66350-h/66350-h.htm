<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>The remains of Hesiod are not alone interesting to
the antiquary, as tracing a picture of the rude arts
and manners of the ancient Greeks. His sublime
philosophic allegories; his elevated views of a retributive
Providence; and the romantic elegance, or
daring grandeur, with which he has invested the
legends of his mythology, offer more solid reasons
than the accident of coeval existence for the traditional
association of his name with that of Homer.</p>

<p>Hesiod has been translated in Latin hexameters
by Nicolaus Valla, and by Bernardo Zamagna. A
French translation by Jacques le Gras bears date
1586. The earliest essay on his poems by our own
countrymen appears in the old racy version of “The
Works and Days,” by George Chapman, the translator
of Homer, published in 1618. It is so scarce that
Warton in “The History of English Poetry” doubts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
its existence. Some specimens of a work equally curious
from its rareness, and interesting as an example
of our ancient poetry, are appended to this translation.
Parnell has given a sprightly imitation of the Pandora,
under the title of “Hesiod, or the Rise of
Woman:” and Broome, the coadjutor of Pope in
the Odyssey, has paraphrased the battle of the Titans
and the Tartarus.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The translation by Thomas
Cooke omits the splendid heroical fragment of “The
Shield,” which I have restored to its legitimate connexion.
It was first published in 1728; reprinted in
1740; and has been inserted in the collections of
Anderson and Chalmers.</p>

<p>This translator obtained from his contemporaries the
name of “Hesiod Cooke.” He was thought a good
Grecian; and translated against Pope the episode of
Thersites, in the Iliad, with some success; which
procured him a place in the Dunciad:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Be thine, my stationer, this magic gift,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cooke shall be Prior, and Concanen Swift:</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and a passage in “The Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
seems pointed more directly at the affront of the
Thersites:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">From these the world shall judge of men and books,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not from the Burnets, Oldmixons, and Cookes.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Satire, however, is not evidence: and neither these
distichs, nor the sour notes of Pope’s obsequious
commentator, are sufficient to prove, that Cooke, any
more than Theobald and many others, deserved,
either as an author or a man, to be ranked with
dunces. A biographical account of him, with extracts
from his common-place books, was communicated
by Sir Joseph Mawby to the Gentleman’s Magazine:
vol. 61, 62. His edition of Andrew Marvell’s
works procured him the patronage of the Earl
of Pembroke: he was also a writer in the Craftsman.
Johnson has told (Boswell’s Tour to the Hebrides,
p. 25.) that “Cooke lived twenty years on a translation
of Plautus: for which he was always taking
subscriptions.” The Amphitryon was, however, actually
published.</p>

<p>With respect to Hesiod, either Cooke’s knowledge
of Greek was in reality superficial, or his indolence
counteracted his abilities; for his blunders are inexcusably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
frequent and unaccountably gross: not in
matters of mere verbal nicety, but in several important
particulars: nor are these instances, which tend
so perpetually to mislead the reader, compensated by
the force or beauty of his style; which, notwithstanding
some few unaffected and emphatical lines, is, in
its general effect, tame and grovelling. These errors
I had thought it necessary to point out in the notes
to my first edition; as a justification of my own attempt
to supply what I considered as still a desideratum
in our literature. The criticisms are now rescinded;
as their object has been misconstrued into
a design of raising myself by depreciating my predecessor.</p>

<p>Some remarks of the different writers in the reviews
appear to call for reply.</p>

<p>The Edinburgh Reviewer objects, as an instance of
defective translation, to my version of αιδως ουκ’ αγαυη:
which he says is improperly rendered “shame”:
“whereas it rather means that diffidence and want of
enterprise which unfits men from improving their
fortune. In this sense it is opposed by Hesiod to
θαρσος, an active and courageous spirit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span></p>

<p>But the Edinburgh Reviewer is certainly mistaken.
If αιδως is to be taken in this limited sense, what can
be the meaning of the line</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Αιδως η τ’ ανδρας μεγα σινεται ηδ’ ονινησι.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Shame greatly hurts or greatly helps mankind?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the proper antithesis is the αιδως αγαθη, alluded to in a
subsequent line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Αιδω δε τ’ αναιδειη κατοπαζη.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And shamelessness expels the better shame.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The good shame, which deters men from mean
actions, as the evil one depresses them from honest
enterprise.</p>

<p>In my dissertation I had ventured to call in question
the judgment of commentators in exalting their
favourite author: and had doubted whether the meek
forgiving temper of Hesiod towards his brother,
whom he seldom honours with any better title than
“fool,” was very happily chosen as a theme for admiration.
On this the <i>old</i> Critical Reviewer exclaimed
“as if that, and various other gentle expressions,
for example <i>blockhead</i>, <i>goose-cap</i>, <i>dunderhead</i>,
were not frequently terms of endearment:” and
he added his suspicion that “like poor old Lear, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
did not know the difference between a bitter fool and
a sweet one.”</p>

<p>But, as the clown in Hamlet says, “’twill away
from me to you.” The critic is bound to prove,
1st, that νηπις is ever used in this playful sense;
which he has not attempted to do: 2dly, that it is
so used with the aggravating prefix of ΜΕΓΑ νηπιε:
3dly, that it is so used by Hesiod.</p>

<p>Hector’s babe on the nurse’s bosom is described as
νηπιος; and Patroclus weeping is compared by Achilles
to κουρη νηπιη. These words may bear the senses of
“poor innocent;” and of “fond girl;” the former
is tender, the latter playful; but in both places the
word is usually understood in its primitive sense of
“infant.” Homer says of Andromache preparing a
bath for Hector,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Νηπιη! ουδ’ ενοησεν ο μιν μαλα τηλε λοετων</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Χερσιν Αχιλληος δαμασεν γλαυκωπις Αθηνη:</div>
    <div class="verse right">Il. xxii.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fond one! she knew not that the blue-eyed maid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had quell’d him, far from the refreshing bath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath Achilles’ hand.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But this is in commiseration: or would the critic
apply to Andromache the epithet of <i>goose-cap</i>? After<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
all, who in his senses would dream of singling out a
word from an author’s context, and delving in other
authors for a meaning? The question is, not how it
is used by other authors, but how it is used by Hesiod.
Till the Critic favours us with some proofs of Hesiod’s
namby-pamby tenderness towards the brother who
had cheated him of his patrimony, I beg to return
both the quotation and the <i>appellatives</i> upon his
hands.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The London Reviewer censures my choice of blank-verse
as a medium for the ancient hexameter, on the
ground that the closing adonic is more fully represented
by the rounding rhyme of the couplet: but it
may be urged, that the flowing pause and continuous
period of the Homeric verse are more consonant
with our blank measure. In confining the latter to
dramatic poetry, as partaking of the character of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
Greek Iambics, he has overlooked the visible distinction
of structure in our dramatic and heroic blank
verse. With respect to the particular poem, I am
disposed to concede that the general details of the
Theogony might be improved by rhyme: but the more
interesting passages are not to be sacrificed to those
which cannot interest, be they versified how they
may: and as the critic seems to admit that a poem
whose action passes</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Beyond the flaming bounds of time and space”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">may be fitly clothed with blank numbers, by this
admission he gives up the argument as it affects the
Theogony.</p>

<p>In disapproving of my illustration of Hesiod by
the Bryantian scheme of mythology, the London
Reviewer refers me for a refutation of this system to
Professor Richardson’s preface to his Arabic Dictionary;
where certain etymological combinations and
derivations are contested, which Mr. Bryant produces
as authorities in support of the adoration of the
Sun or of Fire. Mr. Richardson, however, premises
by acknowledging “the penetration and judgement
of the author of the Analytic System in the refutation
of vulgar errors, with the new and informing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
light in which he has placed a variety of ancient
facts:” and however formidable the professor’s criticisms
may be in this his peculiar province, it must
be remarked that a great part of “The New System”
rests on grounds independent of etymology; and is
supported by a mass of curious evidence collected
from the history, the rites, and monuments of ancient
nations: nor can I look upon the judgment of
that critic as infallible, who conceives the suspicious
silence of the Persic historians sufficient to set aside
the venerable testimony of Herodotus, and the proud
memorials and patriotic traditions of the free people
of Greece: and who resolves the invasion of Xerxes
into the petty piratical inroad of a Persian Satrap.
I conceive, also, with respect to the point in dispute,
that the professor’s confutation of certain etymological
positions is completely weakened in its intended
general effect, by his scepticism as to the universality
of a diluvian tradition. If we admit that the periodical
overflowings of the Nile might have given
rise to superstitious observances and processions in
Ægypt; and even that the sudden inundations of the
Euphrates and the Tigris might have caused the institution
of similar memorials in Babylonia, how are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
we to account for Greece, and India, and America,
each visited by a destructive inundation, and each
perpetuating its remembrance by poetical legends or
emblematical sculptures? Surely a most incredible
supposition. Nor is this all; for we find an agreement
not merely of a flood, but of persons preserved
from a flood; and preserved in a remarkable manner;
by inclosure in a vessel, or the hollow trunk of a tree.
How is it possible to solve coincidences of so minute
and specific a nature<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> by casual inundations, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
Mr. Richardson, or, with Dr. Gillies, by the natural
proneness of the human mind to the weaknesses and
terrors of superstition?</p>

<p>As to my choice of the Analytic System for the
purpose of illustrating Hesiod, I am not convinced
by the argument either of the London or the Edinburgh
Reviewer, that it is a system too extensive to
serve for the illustration of a single author, or that
my task was necessarily confined to literal explanation
of the received mythology. In this single author are
concentrated the several heathen legends and heroical
fables, and the whole of that popular theology which
the author of the New System professed to analyse.
Tzetzes, in his scholia upon Hesiod, interpreted the
theogonic traditions by the phenomena of nature and
the operations of the elements: Le Clerc by the
hidden sense which he traced from Phœnician primitives:
and to these Cooke, in his notes, added
the moral apologues of Lord Bacon. In departing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
therefore, from the beaten track of the school-boy’s
Pantheon, I have only exercised the same freedom
which other commentators and translators have
assumed before me.</p>

with his wife, children, and several animals, on a raft. The
painting represents him in the midst of the water lying in a bark.
The mountain, the summit of which, crowned by a tree, rises
above the waters, is the peak of Colhuacan, the Ararat of the
Mexicans. The men born after the deluge were dumb: a dove,
from the top of the tree distributes among them tongues. When
the great Spirit ordered the waters to withdraw, Tezpi sent out a
vulture. This bird did not return on account of the number of
carcases, with which the earth, newly dried up, was strewn. He
sent out other birds; one of which, the humming-bird, alone returned,
holding in its beak a branch covered with leaves.—Ought
we not to acknowledge the traces of a common origin, wherever
cosmogonical ideas, and the first traditions of nations, offer striking
analogies, even in the minutest circumstances? Does not the

<span class="smaller">ON THE LIFE OF HESIOD.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>It is remarked by Velleius Paterculus (Hist. lib. i.)
that “Hesiod had avoided the negligence into which
Homer fell, by attesting both his country and his
parents: but that of his country he had made most
reproachful mention; on account of the fine which
she had imposed on him.” There are sufficient coincidences
in the poems of Hesiod, now extant, to
explain the grounds of this assertion of Paterculus;
but the statement is loose and incorrect.</p>

<p>As to the mention of his country, if by country
we are to suppose the place of his birth, it can only
be understood by implication, and that not with certainty.
Hesiod indeed relates that his father migrated
from Cuma in Æolia, to Ascra, a Bœotian village at
the foot of mount Helicon; but we are left to conjecture
whether he himself was born at Cuma or at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
Ascra. His affirmation that he had never embarked
in a ship but once, when he sailed across the Euripus
to the Isle of Eubœa on occasion of a poetical contest,
has been thought decisive of his having been
born at Ascra; but the poet is speaking of his nautical
experience: and even if he had originally come
from Cuma, he would scarcely mention a voyage
made in infancy. The observation respecting his
parents tends to countenance the reading of Διου γενος;
race of Dius; instead of διον γενος, race divine; but
the name of one parent only is found. The reproachful
mention of his country plainly alludes to
his charge of corruption against the petty kings or
nobles, who exercised the magistracy of Bœotia: and
by the fine is meant the judicial award of the larger
share of the patrimony to his brother.</p>

<p>There seems a great probability that Virgil, in his
fourth eclogue, had Hesiod’s golden and heroic ages
in view; and that he alludes to the passage of Justice
leaving the earth, where he says</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The virgin now returns: Saturnian times</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roll round again:</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and to Hesiod himself in the verse,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The last age dawns, in verse Cumæan sung:<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">and not, as is commonly thought, to the Sibyl of Campanian
Cuma. Professor Heyne objects, that Hesiod
makes no mention of the revolution of a better age:
yet such an allusion is significantly conveyed in the
following passage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Oh would that Nature had denied me birth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Midst this fifth race, this iron age of earth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That long before within the grave I lay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or long hereafter could behold the day!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That Virgil elsewhere calls Hesiod’s verse Ascræan is
no argument against his supposing him of Cuma:
there seems no reason why either epithet should not
be used: for the poet was at least of Cumæan extraction.
That Ascræus was Hesiod’s received surname
among the ancients proves nothing as to his
birth-place, nor is any thing proved as to Virgil’s
opinion by his adoption of the title in compliance
with common usage. Apollonius was surnamed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
Rhodius from his residence at Rhodes, yet his birth-place
was Ægypt. After all, nothing is established,
even if it could be certified that Virgil thought him
of Cuma, beyond the single weight of Virgil’s individual
opinion. Plutarch relates, from a more ancient
and therefore a more competent authority, that
of Ephorus, the Cumæan historian, that Dius was
the youngest of three brothers, and emigrated through
distress of debt to Ascra; where he married Pycimede,
the mother of Hesiod.</p>

<p>If we allow the authenticity of the proem to the
Theogony, Hesiod tended sheep in the vallies of
Helicon; for it is not in the spirit of ancient poetry
to feign this sort of circumstance; and no education
could be conceived more natural for a bard who sang
of husbandry. From the fiction of the Muses presenting
him with a laurel-bough, we may infer also
that he was not a minstrel or harper, but a rhapsodist;
and sang or recited to the branch instead of the
lyre. La Harpe, in his Lycée, <i>ou Cours de Littérature</i>,
asserts that Hesiod was a priest of the temple of the
Muses. I find the same account in Gale’s Court of
the Gentiles; book iii. p. 7. vol. i. who quotes Carion’s
Chronicle of Memorable Events. For this,
however, I can find no ancient authority. On referring
to Pausanias, he mentions, indeed, that the
statue of Hesiod was placed in the temple of the
Muses on Mount Helicon: and in the Works and
Days Hesiod mentions having dedicated to the Muses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
of Helicon the tripod which he won in the Eubœan
contest; and observes</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ inspiring Muses to my lips have giv’n</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The love of song, and strains that breathe of heaven.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From the conjunction of this passage with the account
of Pausanias, has probably arisen a confused
supposition that Hesiod was actually a priest of the
Heliconian temple. The circumstance, although destitute
of express evidence, is however probable, from
his acquaintance with theogonical traditions and his
tone of religious instruction.</p>

<p>Guietus rejects the whole passage as supposititious,
which respects the voyage to Eubœa, and the contest
in poetry at the funeral games of Amphidamas.
Proclus supposes Plutarch to have also rejected it:
because he speaks of the contest as τα εωλα πραγματα:
which some interpret trite or threadbare tales: others
old wives’ stories. But if the latter sense be the correct
one, Plutarch may have meant to intimate his
disbelief only of Hesiod and Homer having contended;
not altogether of a contest in which Hesiod
took part. In fact it seems reasonable to infer the authenticity
of the passage from this very tradition
of Homer and Hesiod having disputed a prize in
poetry.</p>

<p>In the pseudo-history entitled “The Contest of
Homer and Hesiod,” is an inscription purporting to
be that on the tripod which Hesiod won from Homer
in Eubœa:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This Hesiod vow’d to Helicon’s blest nine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Victor in Chalcis crown’d o’er Homer, bard divine.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now that the passage in “The Works” was extant
long before this piece was in existence, is susceptible
of easy proof: but if we conceive with the
credulity of Barnes, that the piece is a collection of
scattered traditionary matter of genuine antiquity,
that the passage was not constructed on the narration
may be inferred from the former wanting the name
of Homer. The nullity of purpose in such a forgery
seems to have struck those, who in the indulgence of
the same fanciful whim have substituted, as Proclus
states, for the usual reading in the text of Hesiod,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Υμνω νικησαντα φερειν τριποδ’ ωτωεντα,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the identical verse in the pretended inscription. It
is incredible that any person should take the trouble
of foisting lines into Hesiod’s poem, for the barren
object of inducing a belief that he had won a poetical
prize from some unknown and nameless bard: unless
we were to presume that the forger omitted the
name through a refinement of artifice, that no suspicion
may be excited by its too minute coincidence
with the traditionary story: but it is a perfectly natural
circumstance that the passage in Hesiod, describing
a contest with some unknown bard, should
have furnished the basis of a meeting between Hesiod<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi"></a>[xxi]</span>
and Homer: and the tradition is at once explained
by the coincidence of this passage in “The Works,”
and an invocation in the “Hymn to Venus;” where
Homer exclaims on the eve of one of these bardic
festivals,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh in this contest let me bear away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The palm of song: do thou prepare my lay!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The piece entitled “The Contest of Homer and
Hesiod,” is entitled to no authority. It is not credible
that a composition of this nature, consisting of
enigmas with their solutions, and of lines of imperfect
sense which are completed by the alternate verses
of the answerer, should have been preserved by the
oral tradition of ages like complete poems: and the
foolish genealogies, whereby Homer and Hesiod are
traced to Gods, Muses, and Rivers, and are made
cousins, according to the favourite zeal of the Greeks
for finding out a consanguinity in poets, diminish all
the credit of the writer as a sober historian.</p>

<p>It appears probable that the whole piece was suggested
by the hint of the contest in Plutarch: who
quotes it in his “Banquet of Sages,” as an example
of the ancient contests in poetry. He says Homer
proposed this enigma:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Rehearse, O Muse! the things that ne’er have been,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor e’er shall in the future time be seen:</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which Hesiod answered in a manner no less enigmatical:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When round Jove’s tomb the clashing cars shall roll</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The trampling coursers straining for the goal</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii"></a>[xxii]</span></p>

<p>The same verses, with a few changes, are given in
“The Contest;” only the question is assigned to
Hesiod, and the answer to Homer; as Robinson conjectures,
with perhaps too much refinement, for the
secret purpose of depressing Hesiod under the mask
of exalting him, by appointing Homer to the more
arduous task of solving the questions proposed.
With respect also to the award of Panœdes, the
judge, which is thought to betray the same design
by an imbecile or partial preference of the verses of
Hesiod to those of Homer, the reason stated by
Panœdes, that “it was just to bestow the prize on
him who exhorted men to agriculture and peace, in
preference to him who described only war and carnage”
is equally noble and philosophical; and by no
means merits to have given rise to the proverbial
parody quoted by Barnes: Πανιδος ψηφος “the judgment
of Pan:” instead of Πανοιδου ψηφος, “the judgment
of Panœdes.”</p>

<p>The piece seems to be a mere exercise of ingenuity,
without any particular design of raising one poet at
the expence of the other: and as it contains internal
evidence of having been composed after the
time of Adrian, who is mentioned by name as “that
most divine Emperor,” and Plutarch flourished under
Trajan, there is reason to suppose that the narrative
of Periander in the “Banquet of Wise Men,”
afforded the first hint of the whole contest.</p>

<p>To the same zeal for making Hesiod and Homer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiii"></a>[xxiii]</span>
competitors we owe another inscription, quoted by
Eustathius, ad Il. A. p. 5.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In Delos first did I with Homer raise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rhapsody of bards; and new the lays:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Phœbus Apollo did our numbers sing;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latona’s son, the golden-sworded king.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But if the passage in “The Works” be authentic,
the spuriousness of this inscriptive record
detects itself; as Hesiod there confines his voyages
to the crossing the Euripus.</p>

<p>Pausanias mentions the institution of a contest at
the temple in Delphos, where a hymn was to be sung
in honour of Apollo: and says that Hesiod was excluded
from the number of the candidates because he
had not learnt to sing to the harp. He adds, that
Homer came thither also; and was incapacitated
from trying his skill by the same deficiency: and,
what is very strange, he gives as a reason why he
could not have taken a part in the contest, even were
he a harper, that he was blind.</p>

<p>From Plutarch, Pausanias, and the author of
“The Contest,” we are enabled to cull some gossiping
traditions of the latter life of Hesiod, which are
scarcely worth the gleaning, except that, like the romancing
Lives of Homer, they are proofs of the
poet’s celebrity.</p>

<p>Hesiod, we are told, set out on a pilgrimage to the
Delphic Oracle, for the purpose of hearing his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiv"></a>[xxiv]</span>
fortune: and the old bard could scarcely get in at
the gates of the temple, when the prophetess could
refrain no longer: “<i>afflata est numine quando jam
propriore Dei</i>:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Blest is the man who treads this hallow’d ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With honours by th’ immortal Muses crown’d:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bard whose glory beams divinely bright</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Far as the morning sheds her ambient light:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But shun the shades of fam’d Nemean Jove;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy mortal end awaits thee in the grove.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But after all her sweet words, the priestess was
but a jilting gypsey; and meant only to shuffle with
the ambiguity of her trade. The old gentleman
carefully turning aside from the Peloponnesian
Nemea, fell into the trap of a temple of the Nemean
Jupiter at Ænoe, a town of Locris. He was here
entertained by one Ganyctor; together with a Milesian,
his fellow-traveller, and a youth called Troilus.
During the night this Milesian violated the daughter
of their host, by name Ctemene: and the grey hairs
of Hesiod, who we are told was an old man twice
over,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and whose name grew into a proverb for longevity,
could not save him from being suspected of
the deed by the young lady’s brothers, Ctemenus and
Antiphus: they without much ceremony murdered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv"></a>[xxv]</span>
him in the fields, and “to leave no botches in the
work,” killed the poor boy into the bargain. The
Milesian, we are to suppose, escaped under the
cloud of his miraculous security, free from gashes
and from question. The body of Hesiod was thrown
into the sea; and a dolphin,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> or a whole shoal
of them, according to another account, conveyed
it to a part of the coast, where the festival of
Neptune was celebrating: and the murderers, having
confessed, were drowned in the waves. Plutarch
(<i>de solertiâ animalium</i>) states that the corpse of
Hesiod was discovered through the sagacity of his
dog.</p>

<p>The body of a murdered poet, however, was not to
rest quiet without effecting some further extraordinary
prodigies. The inhabitants of Orchomenos, in
Bœotia, having consulted the oracle on occasion of a
pestilence, were answered that, as their only remedy,
they must seek the bones of Hesiod; and that a crow
would direct them. The messengers accordingly
found a crow sitting on a rock; in the cavity of which
they discovered the poet’s remains; transported them
to their own country, and erected a tomb with this
epitaph:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvi"></a>[xxvi]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The fallow vales of Ascra gave him birth:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His bones are cover’d by the Mingan earth:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Supreme in Hellas Hesiod’s glories rise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom men discern by wisdom’s touchstone wise.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Among the Greek Inscriptions is an epitaph on
Hesiod with the name of Alcæus, which has the air
of being a genuine ancient production, from its
breathing the beautiful classic simplicity of the old
Grecian school:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Nymphs in their founts midst Locris’ woodland gloom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laved Hesiod’s corse and piled his grassy tomb:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The shepherds there the yellow honey shed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And milk of goats was sprinkled o’er his head:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With voice so sweetly breathed that sage would sing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who sip’d pure drops from every Muse’s spring.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some mention Ctemene, or Clymene, on whose
account Hesiod is said to have been murdered, as
the name of his wife: others call her Archiepe; and
he is supposed to have had by her a son named
Stesichorus. In “The Works” is this passage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then may not I, nor yet my son remain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In this our generation just in vain:</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which, unless it be only a figure of speech, confirms
the fact of his having a son.</p>

<p>Pausanias describes a brazen statue of Hesiod in
the forum of the city Thespia, in Bœotia; another
in the temple of Jupiter Olympicus, at Olympia in
Elis; and a third in the temple of the Muses, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvii"></a>[xxvii]</span>
Mount Helicon, in a sitting posture, with a harp
resting on his knees; a circumstance which he rather
formally criticises, on the ground that Hesiod recited
with the laurel-branch.</p>

<p>A brazen statue of Hesiod stood also in the baths
of Zeuxippus, which formed a part of old Byzantium,
and retained the same title, an epithet of Jupiter,
under the Christian Emperors of Constantinople.
(See Gibbon’s Roman Empire, ii. 17; Dallaway’s Constantinople,
p. 110.) Constantine adorned the baths
with statues, and for these Christodorus wrote inscriptions.
That on the statue of Hesiod is quoted
by Fulvius Ursinus, from the Greek Epigrams:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Midst mountain nymphs in brass th’ Ascræan stood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Uttering the heaven-breathed song in his infuriate mood.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The collections of antiquities by Fulvius Ursinus,
Gronovius, and Bellorius exhibit a gem, a busto and
a basso-relievo, together with a truncated <i>herma</i>;
which the ingenious artist who designed the frontispiece
to this edition has united with one of the heads.
The bust in the Pembroke collection differs from all
these. In fact the sculptures, whether of Hesiod or
Homer, are only interesting as antiquities of art;
for the likenesses assigned to eminent poets by the
Grecian artists were mostly imaginary:<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and must
evidently have been so in such ancient instances as these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxviii"></a>[xxviii]</span></p>

<p>Greece, at an early period, seems to have possessed
a spirit of just legislation, which formed in the very
bosom of polytheism a certain code of practical religion:
and from the semi-barbarous age of Orpheus,
down to the times of a Solon, a Plato, and a Pindar,
Providence continued to raise up moral instructors of
mankind, in the persons of bards, or legislators, or
philosophers, who by their conceptions of a righteous
governor of the universe, and their maxims of social
duty and natural piety, counteracted the degrading
influence of superstition on the manners of the people:
and sowed the germs of that domestic and public
virtue which so long upheld in power and prosperity
the sister communities of Greece. The same
spirit pervades the writings of Hesiod.</p>

<p>It is evident even in the times that have passed
since the gospel light was shed abroad among the
nations, that a perverted system of theology may
perfectly consist with a pure practical religion: that
scholastic subtleties, unscriptural traditions, and uncharitable
dogmas, may constitute the creed, while the
religion of primitive Christianity influences the heart.
So, in estimating the character of Hesiod, we must
separate those superstitions which belong to a traditionary
mythology, from that system of opinions
which respected the guidance of human life; the accountableness
of nations and individuals to a heavenly
judge; and the principles of public equity and popular
justice which he derived from the national institutions.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxix"></a>[xxix]</span>
If we examine his poems in this view of their
tendency and spirit, we shall find abundant cause for
admiration and respect of a man, who, born and nurtured
upon the lap of heathen superstition, could
shadow out the maxims of truth in such beautiful
allegories, and recommend the practice of virtue in
such powerful and affecting appeals to the conscience
and the reason.</p>

<p>They, however, who can feel the infinite superiority
of Christianity over every system of philosophic
morals, will naturally expect that the morality of
Hesiod should come short of that point of purity,
which he, who reads our nature, proposed through
the revealer of his will as a standard for the emulation
of his creatures. But in the zeal of commenting
upon an adopted author, we find that every thing
equivocal has been strained to some unobjectionable
sense; we are presented with Christian graces for
heathen virtues; and Hesiod is not permitted to be
absurd even in his superstitions; which are thought
to involve some refined emblematical meaning; some
lesson of ethical wisdom or of economical prudence.</p>

<p>The similitude of patriarch and prophet, with
whom he is compared by Robinson, is not a very
exaggerated comparison, in so far as respects the
simplicity of an ancient husbandman, laying down
rules for the general œconomy of life; or the graver
functions of a philosopher, denouncing the visitations
of divine justice on nations and their legislators,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxx"></a>[xxx]</span>
greedy of the gains of corruption. But the learned
editor is unfortunate in selecting for his praise the meek
and placable disposition of Hesiod as completing the
patriarchal character. The indignation which Hesiod
felt at the injuries done him by a brother, and the
venality of his judges, might reasonably excuse the
bitterness of rebuke: but he should not be held up
as a model of equanimity and forbearance. To this
graceless brother he seldom ever addresses himself in
any gentler terms than μεγα νηπιε, <i>greatly foolish</i>: and
I question whether Perses, if he could rise from the
dead, would confess himself very grateful for the
tenderness of this reprehension.</p>

<p>The adverse decision in the law-suit with his brother
must be confessed to be the hinge on which the
alleged corruptness of his times perpetually turns:
yet as he does not conceal the personal interest which
he has in the question, his frankness wins our confidence;
and simplicity and candour are so plainly
marked in his grave and artless style, that we are insensibly
led to form an exception in his favour as to
the judgment of the character from the writer; to
believe his praises of frugality and temperance sincere;
and to coincide with Paterculus, in the opinion
that he was a man of a contented and philosophical
mind, “fond of the leisure and tranquillity” of rustic
life.</p>

<p>His countrymen, as Addison expresses it, must
have regarded him “as the oracle of the neighbourhood.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxi"></a>[xxxi]</span>
Plutarch adverts to his medical knowledge,
in the person of Cleodemus the physician; and when
we consider that he possessed sufficient astronomy for
the purposes of agriculture, and that he carried his
zeal for science even into nautical details, of which,
notwithstanding, he confesses his inexperience, we
shall acknowledge him to have been a man of extraordinary
attainments for the times in which he lived.</p>

<h4>FOOTNOTES</h4>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> It has been a favourite theory of learned men, that Virgil had
access to Sibylline prophecies, which foretold the birth of a
Saviour. How came the Sibyls, any more than the Pythonesses
of Delphos, to be ranked on a sudden with the really inspired
prophets? or is it credible that they should have had either the
curiosity, or the power, to inspect the Jewish Scriptures? The
“Sibylline Verses” were confessedly interpolated, if not fabricated,
by the pious fraud of Monks. The imitations from Isaiah
seem no less chimerical. Every description of a golden age
among the poets may be wrested into a similar parallel. Nor
is it to be conceived that Virgil would have produced so dry a
copy of so luxuriant an original. This argument does not affect
the extraordinary coincidence of the time of the appearance of
this eclogue, with the epoch of the Messiah’s birth; which is
exceedingly curious.</p>

<span class="smaller">ON THE ÆRA OF HESIOD.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The question of the æra when Hesiod flourished,
and whether he were the elder or the junior of Homer,
or his contemporary, has given rise to such endless
disputes, that Pausanias declines giving any opinion
on the subject. Some of the moderns have attempted
to ascertain the point from internal evidence: 1st, by
the character of style: 2dly, by philological criticism:
3dly, by astronomical calculation.</p>

<p>In the first instance they are unfortunately by no
means agreed. Justus Lipsius asserts that a greater
simplicity and more of the rudeness of antiquity are
apparent in Hesiod: Salmasius insists that Hesiod
is more smooth and finished, and less imbued with
antiquity than Homer.</p>

<p>As to the argument of Heinsius respecting
τεκμαιρομαι being used by Homer in the sense of <i>to
effect</i> or <i>bring to pass</i>, and by Hesiod in that of <i>to
appoint</i>, <i>contrive</i>, or <i>will</i>; and as to the former being
the more ancient acceptation; the proof totally fails:
inasmuch as Homer has repeatedly used the word <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiii"></a>[xxxiii]</span>in
the latter sense: and with regard to the use of
θεμιστας by Homer for law, when Hesiod uses νομους,
which is asserted not to have been known in Homer’s
age, the objection is vague; unless we suppose that
Homer’s poems<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> contained every word in the language.
The argument of the celebrated Dr. Samuel
Clarke, in favour of their being of a different age,
and of Hesiod being the junior, turns on the word
καλος; which in Homer is invariably made long in
the first syllable; whereas Hesiod makes it either
long or short at pleasure: and on the word οπωρινος;
of which the penult is long in Homer, and short in
Hesiod. But should the argument affect their being
coeval, it does not appear why Hesiod might not be
the elder: for who will be bold enough to decide as
to the most ancient quantity? nor could we possibly
determine the question, unless we were in possession
of other poets, contemporary with Homer, who should
be found to conform exactly with the Homeric prosody:
in which case the disagreement of Hesiod might
favour a presumption of his belonging, at least, to a
different age. The criticism seems, however, in all
respects unworthy of so acute a reasoner as Dr.
Clarke: for surely the difference of country alone
might induce a difference of prosodial usage, no less
than a dissimilarity of dialect. But the most decisive
answer to all such minute criticisms appears to be,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiv"></a>[xxxiv]</span>
that all the evidence afforded us on historical authority
respecting the discovery, collection, and arrangement
of the poems ascribed to Homer, justifies the
presumption that their dialect, diction, and prosody
have undergone<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> such modifications and changes, as
to baffle all chronological reasoning drawn from the
present state of the poems.</p>

<p>Scaliger and Vossius have thought that the æra of
Hesiod could be ascertained within seventy years,
more or less, by astronomical calculation, from the
following passage of The Works and Days.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When sixty days have circled, since the sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turn’d from his wintry tropic, then the star</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Arcturus, leaving ocean’s sacred flood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">First whole-apparent makes his evening rise.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is singular that so great a philosopher as Dr.
Priestley should also have argued for the certainty of
the same method of chronology in this instance of
Hesiod. (Lectures on History, Lect. xii. p. 99.)
But neither the accuracy nor the precise nature of
the astronomical observation here commemorated
can possibly be ascertained. It is uncertain whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxv"></a>[xxxv]</span>
the single star Arcturus may not be placed for the
whole constellation of Boötes; of which there are
examples in Columella, and other writers. It is
wholly uncertain whether this rising was observed in
Hesiod’s own country, or even in Hesiod’s own time;
a knowledge of both which particulars is essential to
our making a just calculation. We shall scarcely
ascribe to Hesiod a more scientific accuracy than to
subsequent astronomers; yet we find that even <i>their</i> observations
of the solstices and of the risings and settings
of the stars, are ambiguous, and most probably
fallacious. Hesiod makes the achronycal rising of
Arcturus sixty days after the winter solstice: many
other writers, and particularly Pliny, say the same.
Now setting the difference between Hesiod and Pliny at
800 years, this will make a difference of eleven days
in the time of the phænomenon. Both therefore
cannot have written from actual observation, and
probably neither did. The ancients copied from
each other without scruple; because they knew not
till the time of Hipparchus, that the times of rising
&amp;c. varied by the course of ages. They seem besides
to have copied from writers of various latitudes:
unconscious that this also made a difference. We
shall not then be disposed to rely on this, or similar
passages of Hesiod, for any secure data of chronology.</p>

<p>In the absence of internal evidence we are therefore
referred to the opinions of antiquity. There is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvi"></a>[xxxvi]</span>
remark of Gibbon in that part of his Posthumous
Writings entitled “Extraits raisonnés de mes Lectures,”
which lays down an excellent rule of judgment
in matters of chronology. He very justly observes,
that the differences of chronologers may be reconciled
by the consideration that they reckoned from
different æras of the person’s life. The fixing the
date from different periods, as from the birth or
death, the production of a work,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> or any other remarkable
event of a person’s life, might easily make
the difference of a century. “So that we may
establish it as a rule of criticism, that where these
diversities do not exceed the natural term of human
life we ought to think of reconciling, and not of opposing
them. There are, indeed, many writers, with
respect to Homer, whom it is impossible to conciliate;
since they take in so enormous a period as 416
years, from the return of the Heraclidæ A. C. 1104
to the twenty-third Olympiad A. C. 688. But besides
that they are of inferior note, the great difference
among them leaves the authority of each to
stand singly by itself.”</p>

<p>This reasoning very much diminishes whatever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvii"></a>[xxxvii]</span>
force might be derived from the authority of names,
to the computations of those writers who contend that
Hesiod is a century younger than Homer. These are
the Latin writers; whose concurrence is however so
exact as to induce a belief of their having merely
copied from each other. Thus Velleius Paterculus,
who wrote his history 30 years after Christ, says that
Homer flourished 950 years before his time; that is,
before Christ 920; and Pliny about the year 78 computed
that Homer lived 1000 years before him; before
Christ 920. Paterculus follows Cicero in placing
Hesiod 120 years after Homer: Pliny, Porphyry,
and Solinus, concur in the order of their ages, and
in the interval between them: varying only from ten
to twenty or thirty years. But on the plan laid down
by Gibbon, this chronology might be reconciled with
that of Ephorus, and Varro: who, according to
Aulus Gellius, made Hesiod and Homer contemporaries:
as did Plutarch and Philostratus.</p>

<p>This opinion is supported by the ancient authority
of Herodotus; and by that of the Chronicler of the
Parian Marbles. The authenticity of these marbles
has, indeed, been impugned by a learned dissertation
of Mr. Robertson, printed in 1788. To this an answer
was published in 1789, by Mr. Hewlett: and
Mr. Gough has defended the genuineness of the
Chronicle in a Memoir of the Archæologia, vol. ix.
Gibbon observes, “I respect that monument as a
useful, as an uncorrupt monument of antiquity: but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxviii"></a>[xxxviii]</span>
why should I prefer its authority to that of Herodotus?
it is more modern: (B. C. 264:) its author is
uncertain: we know not from what source he drew
his chronology.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The Parian Marble, however, if not
a modern forgery, may be allowed to stand on the
same footing with other Greek tablets of chronology.</p>

<p>Herodotus was born B. C. 484. He affirms Hesiod
and Homer to have preceded his own time by four
hundred years: thus making them contemporaries;
and fixing their æra at B. C. 884.</p>

<p>The Chronicler of the Marbles fixes the æra of
Hesiod at 944 years B. C.: and that of Homer at
907; by which Hesiod is placed 37 years before
Homer; a difference, however, too trifling to affect
the chronological evidence in favour of their contemporary
existence.</p>

Timæus, who flourished in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus,
first arranged his narrative in the order of Olympiads; which
began B. C. 776. His contemporary Sosibius, gave a work entitled

on such chronologers rests the credit of all later compilers, as
well as of the Arundelian Marbles. <span class="smcap">Dr. Gillies.</span></p>

<span class="smaller">ON THE POEMS OF HESIOD.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span></h3>

</div>

<p>Pausanias informs us that “the Bœotians, who
dwell round Helicon, have a tradition among them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xl"></a>[xl]</span>
that Hesiod wrote nothing besides the poem of
‘Works:’ and from this they take away the introduction,
and say that the poem properly begins with
The Strifes. They showed me a leaden tablet near
the fountain, which was almost entirely eaten away
with age, and on which were engraven the Works
and Days of Hesiod.”</p>

<p>It is difficult to account for the manifest mutilation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xli"></a>[xli]</span>
and corruption of this venerable poet’s compositions,
since it appears that they were extant in a complete,
or at least, a more perfect form, so late as the age of
Vespasian. Pliny, book xiv. complaining of the agricultural
ignorance of his age, observes that even the
names of several trees enumerated by Hesiod had
grown out of knowledge: and in book xv. he adverts
to Hesiod’s opinion of the unprofitableness of the
olive. From some verses in the Astronomicon of
Manilius, an Augustan writer, it would seem that he
had treated of ingrafting, and of the soils adapted to
corn and vines.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He sings how corn in plains, how vines in hills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Delight, how both with vast increase the olive fills:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How foreign grafts th’ adulterous stock receives,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bears stranger fruit and wonders at her leaves.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right"><span class="smcap">Creech.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and it is remarkable that the line in Virgil translated
by Dryden,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And old Ascrean verse through Roman cities sing,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">occurs in that book of the Georgics which is dedicated
to planting, ingrafting, and the dressing of vines.
In the “Works,” as they now appear, we find no
mention of any trees but such as are fit for the fabrication
of the plough: and it is plain that the
countrymen of Pliny could be in no danger of forgetting
the names of the oak, the elm, or the bay-tree.
Of the olive, and of ingrafting, there is no
mention whatever, and but a cursory notice on the
vine: nor is there any comparison of the soils respectively
adapted to the growth of vines and of corn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlii"></a>[xlii]</span></p>

<p>The poem in some editions has been divided into
two books; under the general title of “Works and
Days,” but with a subdivision entitled Days only:
by which arrangement it is made virtually to consist
of three books. In Loesner’s edition the distinction
of the second book is done away: but the subdivision
of Days is retained. From either mode of disposition
this incoherency results: that Works and Days
no longer appear to be the general title, but applicable
only to the former part of the poem, in which
there is no mention of Days at all. The ancient
copies, as Heinsius has shown, had no division into
parts. If any minor distinction be deemed admissible
for the more convenient arrangement of the subject,
the disposition of Henry Stephens is obviously
the most rational: whereby the poem is divided into
two parts: the first entitled “Works” only, and the
second “Days.”</p>

<p>Cooke explains the “Works” of Hesiod to mean
the labours of agriculture, and the “Days” the
proper seasons for the Works; but erroneously. The
term <i>Works</i> is to be taken with greater latitude, as
including not only labours, but actions; and as referring
equally to the moral, as to the industrious
œconomy of human life. It is evident also that the
term “Days” does not respect the seasons of labour
specified in the course of the poem, but the days of
superstitious observance at the end of it: and of
these many have no reference whatever to the works
of husbandry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliii"></a>[xliii]</span></p>

<p>The Theogony has all the appearance of being a
patchwork of fragments; consisting of some genuine
Hesiodéan passages;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> pieced together with verses of
other poets, and probably of a different age. The
mythology is occasionally inconsistent with itself: thus
the god Chrysaor is re-introduced among the demi-gods;
and the Fates are born over again from different
parents: an incongruity which Robinson attempts
to obviate by an ingenious, but over-refined construction.</p>

<p>The proem bears the internal marks of comparatively
modern refinement. It has not the simple
outline of Hesiod. The whole passage has the air of
one of those introductions which the rhapsodists
were accustomed to prefix to their recitations: it is
conceived in a more florid taste than the usual composition
of Hesiod, but expressed with considerable
elegance of fancy.</p>

<p>These arguments are not affected by the individual
opinions of Romans and Greeks, themselves modern
with respect to Hesiod. Ovid in his “Art of Love”
alludes to this proem:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliv"></a>[xliv]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The sister Muses did I ne’er behold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While, Ascra! midst thy vales, I fed my fold.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Plutarch in the ninth book of his Symposiacs, quotes
two of the verses in illustration of the propriety of
epithets: Pausanias appeals to the presentation of
the branch as evidence that Hesiod did not sing to
the lyre; and Lucian in his dialogue “on the illiterate
book-collector” observes, “how can you
have known these things without having learnt them?
how or whence? unless at any time you have received
a branch from the Muses like that shepherd.
They, indeed, did not disdain to appear to the shepherd,
though a rough hairy man, with a sun-burnt
complexion; but they would never have deigned to
come near you:” and in the “Dialogue with Hesiod”
he banters him as promising to sing of futurity; and
affecting the Chalcas or Phineas, when there is nothing
of prophecy in his whole poem. An indirect argument
for the spuriousness of the verses.</p>

<p>It must have been an impression of this proem
which led Gibbon in his “Notes on the editions of
the Classics” (Miscellaneous Works, vol. v.) to observe,
“in the Theogony I can discern a more recent
hand:” for many details in the poem have all the
internal evidence of antiquity. Perhaps the catalogue
of names, which Robinson superfluously defends
on the score of their metrical harmony, and compares
with Homer’s catalogue of ships, of which the merit
is geographical and historical, may furnish a strong
presumptive argument of antiquity. They would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlv"></a>[xlv]</span>
appear to have been composed at a period when alphabetic
writing was unknown, and the memory of
names and things depended on the technical help of
oral tradition.</p>

<p>Pausanias says, speaking of the Theogony, “There
are some who consider Hesiod as the author of this
poem.” That <i>some</i> theogony was composed by Hesiod
is evidenced by the passage in Herodotus; who, speaking
of Hesiod and Homer, affirms, “these are they
who framed a Theogony for the Greeks:” and the
fable of Pandora in the Theogony, that we now possess,
bears characteristical marks of having come from
the same hand as that in the Works and Days.</p>

<p>Of the Shield of Hercules it is asserted by Cooke,
that “there is great reason to believe this poem was
not in existence in the time of Augustus:” but he
merely advances, in proof of this assertion, that
“Manilius, who was an author of the Augustan
age, takes notice of no other than the Theogony,
and the Works and Days:” yet this, if indeed anything
decisive could be concluded from the omission,
would only prove that he did not believe the piece
authentic. He further remarks that critics should not
suppose it to have formed a part of another poem,
unless they could show when, where, or by whom
the title had been changed. This is surely to demand
a very unreasonable as well as unnecessary kind of
proof. The distinct title affords, in fact, no evidence
for the completeness of the poem; as we learn from
Ælian, that portions of Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlvi"></a>[xlvi]</span>
were known by such separate titles as, “the Funeral
Games of Patroclus,” the “Grot of Calypso;” and sung
as detached pieces. The argument of Cooke that it
cannot be an imitation of the Shield of Achilles,
because the description of the mere Shield occupies
but a small part of the piece, is equivalent to contending
that Virgil could not have imitated the simile
of Diana in the first book of the Æneid from the
Odyssey, because the rest of the book bears no resemblance
to any thing in Homer. A slight presumption
of the Shield being from the hand of
Hesiod may be founded on a quotation of Polybius,
from one of Hesiod’s lost works: the historian speaks
of the Macedonians as being “such as Hesiod describes
the Æacidæ; rejoicing in war rather than in
the banquet:” book v. ch. i. In the Shield, Iölaus
says of himself and Hercules, that battles “are better
to them than a feast.” The expression, however,
may have been proverbial, and used by more poets
than one.</p>

<p>The poem is ascribed to Hesiod by Athenæus: but
Aristophanes the grammarian rejected it as spurious,
and Longinus speaks doubtingly of Hesiod being the
author. Tanaquil Faber confidently asserts “that
they who think the Shield not of Hesiod, have but a
very superficial acquaintance with Grecian poetry:”
and on the other side Joseph Scaliger speaks of the
author, whoever he may be, of the Shield; which
the critical world by a preposterous judgment have
attributed to the poet of Ascra. It is not by a reference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlvii"></a>[xlvii]</span>
to authorities that the question must be decided,
but by an examination of the interior structure
of the poem, and the evidence of style.</p>

<p>The objections to a great part of the poem consist
in its unlikeness to the style of Hesiod, and its resemblance
to that of Homer.</p>

<p>Robinson insists in reply that it is very usual for
the same author to show a diversity of style; which
is at least an admission that Hesiod is here different
from himself. But to his question “whether we demand
the same fervour and force in the Georgics of
Virgil as in the Æneid?” it may be asked in return
whether a certain similarity of style be not clearly
distinguishable in these poems, however distinct their
nature? there is, indeed, a difference, but not absolutely
a discordance.</p>

<p>The whole laboured argument which he has bestowed
on the necessary dissimilarity of didactic and
heroical composition is plainly foreign to the question.
Who would dream of urging as an objection to its
authenticity, that the style of “The Shield” is
unlike the <i>georgical</i> style of Hesiod? the objection
is, that it is unlike his <i>epic</i> style: and Robinson has
brought the question to a fair issue by his remark
that the Battle of the Gods abounds no less than the
Shield with the ornaments of poetry.</p>

<p>It is not sufficient that these passages respectively
display ornament; we must examine whether they
display a similar style of ornament. Now the descriptive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlviii"></a>[xlviii]</span>
part of the Shield is in a gorgeous taste;
unlike the bold and simple majesty of the Theogony.
There is a visible effort to surprise by something marvellous
and uncommon; which often verges on conceit
and extravagance. For sublime images we are
presented with gigantic and distorted figures, and
with hideous conceptions of disgusting horror. There
is indeed a considerable degree of genius even in
these faulty passages: but whoever perceives a resemblance
in the imagery of the Shield to that of
the Titanic War, may equally trace an affinity between
Virgil and Ariosto.</p>

<p>These reasonings affect that part of the poem
chiefly, which is occupied with the mere description
of the Shield; but a single circumstance will show
that the passages which represent the action of the
poem are both foreign to Hesiod’s manner, and are
in the manner of Homer. I allude to the employment
of similes and to the character of those similes.</p>

<p>Homer is fond of comparisons; and of such, particularly,
as are drawn from animated nature. The
Shield of Hercules also abounds with similes, and
they are precisely of this sort. But the frequent use
of similitudes is so far from being characteristic of
Hesiod, that in the whole Battle of the Giants but
one occurs; and only one in the Combat of Jupiter
and Typhæus; and in both we look in vain for any
comparison drawn from lions, or boars, or vultures.</p>

<p>Robinson appears, indeed, conscious of a more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlix"></a>[xlix]</span>
crowded and diversified imagery in the Shield than
we usually meet with in Hesiod’s poetry; for he is
driven to the miserable alternative of supposing that
Hesiod may have produced the Shield in his youth,
and his other works in his old age. Longinus in the
same manner accounts for the comparative quiet simplicity
of the Odyssey. The supposition in either
case is founded on the erroneous principle, that a
poem is beautiful in proportion to the noise and fury
of its action, or the accumulation of its ornament.
The notion of the genius necessarily declining with the
decline of youthful vigour is completely unphilosophical;
and is contradicted by repeated experience of
the human faculties. It was in his old age that
Dryden wrote his “Fables.”</p>

<p>As to that portion of the poem which is properly
the Shield, and from which the whole piece takes its
title, it is self-evident that this must have been borrowed
from the description in the Iliad, or the description
in the Iliad from this. I do not allude
merely to a whole series of verses being literally the
same in each; but to long passages of description,
bearing so close a resemblance as to preclude the idea
of accidental coincidence; such as the bridal procession,
the siege, the harvest, and the vintage.</p>

<p>Robinson admits the imitation; but thinks the
partisans of Homer cannot easily show that Homer
was not the copyist. It were, however, easy to decide
from internal evidence which is the copy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_l"></a>[l]</span></p>

<p>Where two poems are found so nearly resembling
each other as to convey at once the impression of
plagiarism, the scale of originality must doubtless
preponderate in favour of that which is the more
simple in style and invention. Where a poem
abounds with florid figures and irregular flights of
imagination, it is inconceivable that a <i>copy</i> of that
poem should exhibit a chaste simplicity of fancy: but
it is highly natural that an imitator should think to
transcend his original by the aid of meretricious ornament;
that he should mistake bombast for sublimity,
and attempt to dazzle and astonish. Of this
sort of elaborate refinement a single instance will
serve in illustration.</p>

<p>Both poets encircle their bucklers with the ocean.
Robinson gives the preference to the author of The
Shield of Hercules; alleging that his description is
decorated with the utmost beauty of imagery; while
that of The Shield of Achilles is naked of embellishment.
To the unornamented style of the passage
in Homer I appeal, as demonstrating the superiority
of his judgment, and as thereby establishing beyond
dispute the fact of his originality.</p>

<p>In one condensed verse he pours around the verge
of the buckler “the great strength of the ocean
stream.” An image of roundness and completeness
is here at once presented to the eye, and fills the mind.
But the author of the Shield of Hercules, evidently
striving to excel Homer, says that “high-soaring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_li"></a>[li]</span>
swans there clamoured aloud, and many floated on
the surface of the billows, and near them fishes were
leaping tumultuously.” Who does not perceive that
the full image of the rounding ocean is broken and
rendered indistinct by this multiplicity of images?
The description is, indeed, picturesque; <i>at nunc non
erat his locus</i>.</p>

<p>Yet that Hesiod was the plagiarist will scarcely be
contended, until the assertion already advanced respecting
the epic simplicity of his style shall have
been set aside.</p>

<p>But the former part of the piece has all the internal
marks of having been composed by an author of
totally dissimilar genius. It has the stamp of the
ancient simplicity upon it. A few passages are magnificent;
but still in a noble and pure taste. Here
then I discern the hand of Hesiod. But the presumption
rests on surer grounds than characteristics
of style.</p>

<p>In the concluding verses of the Theogony, the
poet invokes the Muses to sing the praises of women;
and among the lost works of Hesiod, whose titles
are dispersed in ancient authors, are enumerated the
four Catalogues of Women or Heroines; and the
Herogony, or Generation of Heroes descended from
them; which are thought to have been five connected
parts of the same poem. That this was the work of
Hesiod we have the testimony of Pausanias; who
alludes to the tale of Aurora and Cephalus, and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lii"></a>[lii]</span>
of Iphigenia, as treated by Hesiod in his Catalogue
of Women. The fourth Catalogue had acquired a
secondary title of Ηοιαι μεγαλαι; the great Eoiæ:
fantastically framed out of the words η οιη, or <i>such
as</i>, which introduced the stories of the successive
heroines. From the use of this title a strange idea
got abroad that Eoa was the name of a young woman
of Ascra, the mistress of Hesiod.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Among the minor fragments of Hesiod are preserved
three passages, each beginning with the words
η οιη, introductory of a female description. They are
naturally considered as remnants of the Fourth Catalogue.
Now the piece entitled “The Shield of
Hercules” also opens with these identical words, introductory
of the story of Alcmena.</p>

<p>Fabricius decides that these introductory words
will not permit us to doubt that “The Shield of
Hercules” formed part of the Fourth Catalogue;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_liii"></a>[liii]</span>
but the inference does not necessarily extend beyond
the first portion of the piece. Robinson justly argues
on the incongruity of the poet’s digressing from the
tale of Alcmena, to tell a story of Hercules; and he
therefore conjectures that this piece is a fragment of
the Heroical Genealogies; but aware that the concurrence
of the exordium with the above-mentioned
fragments, points the attention to the Fourth Catalogue,
he cuts the Gordian knot by changing η οιη,
or <i>such as</i>, into η οιη, <i>she alone</i>.</p>

<p>Guietus suggests the reading of ηοιη, <i>rising with the
dawn</i>; for the purpose of rendering the piece complete
in itself: but the very basis of the argument in
favour of the authenticity of the poem as a work of
Hesiod, is the striking coincidence of the introductory
lines with the fragments of the Fourth Catalogue.
This may be set aside by the ingenious expedient
of altering the text; but if the text be suffered
to remain, the presumption, so far as it extends,
is irresistible. I do conceive that Robinson,
when his judgment consented to this alteration of
the reading, yielded a very important advantage to
those who dispute the genuineness of the poem, as
the production of Hesiod; that by the abandonment
of these remarkably coincident words the difficulty
of proving the poem to be a fragment is increased
two-fold; and that with the fact of its being
a fragment is closely linked the fact of its authenticity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_liv"></a>[liv]</span></p>

<p>From what has been said, it will perhaps be thought
extraordinary that the idea of a <i>cento</i> of dispersed
fragments, pieced together and interpolated with
Homeric imitations, never suggested itself to those
critics who have bestowed such elaborate scrutiny on
the composition of the poem.</p>

<p>In the scholium of the Aldine edition of Hesiod,
it is stated, “The beginning of the Shield as far as
the 250th verse is said to form a part of the Fourth
Catalogue.” Here is at once an admission of the
patchwork texture of the piece; and we may be allowed
to conjecture that the scholiast may possibly be
mistaken as to the exact number of lines. This
portion, in fact, comprehends the meeting of Hercules
with Cygnus, and his arming for battle; which
follows, with a strange and startling abruptness, immediately
on his birth; and seems to have little connexion
with the praises of a heroine, in a poem devoted
exclusively to celebrated women.</p>

<p>I should, therefore, be inclined to consider the
first fifty-six lines only as belonging to the Fourth
Catalogue. This introductory part, ending with the
birth of Hercules, is awkwardly coupled with his
warlike adventure in the grove of Apollo by the line</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Who also slew Cygnus, the magnanimous son of Mars.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This line is perceptibly the link of connexion between
the two fragments, and betrays the hand of the
interpolator. The succeeding passage, as far as verse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lv"></a>[lv]</span>
153, I conjecture to have formed a part of the Herogony.
It seems probable that Hesiod’s description
of the sculpture on the Shield of Hercules was limited
to the dragon in the centre, and the figure of
Discord hovering above it; and was meant to end
with the effects produced by the sight of this shield
on the hero’s enemies. This short description appears
to have suggested the experiment of ingrafting upon
it a florid parody of the Shield of Achilles; and that
here precisely we may fix the commencement of the
spurious additions is probable from the verses</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>I suppose, therefore, the description of the putrefying
corses of the foes of Hercules to have joined
the 320th verse; where he is made to grasp the
shield and ascend the chariot. Several of the subsequent
passages, as, in particular, the description of
the Cicada, appear to me genuine; but they are visibly
patched with Homeric similes, which are in
general mere plagiarisms; and are not at all in unison
with the style of the rest of the poem; nor with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lvi"></a>[lvi]</span>
characteristic manner of Hesiod. This mixture of
authenticity and imposture will explain the contradictory
decisions of learned men; who, in examining
this curious question, have looked only at one side.</p>

<p>It does not appear that Hesiod was the most ancient
author either of a theogony or a rural poem;
although Herodotus speaks of him as the first who
framed a theogonic system for the Greeks, and Pliny
cites him as the earliest didactic poet on agriculture.
But tradition has preserved the fame of theogonies by
Orpheus and Musæus: and Tzetzes mentions two
poems of Orpheus, the one entitled <i>Works</i>, the other
<i>Diaries</i>; the archetypes, probably, of The Works
and Days.</p>

<p>Quintilian observes that “Hesiod rarely rises, and
a great part of him is occupied in names; yet he is
distinguished by useful sentences conveying precepts,
and a commendable sweetness of words and construction;
and the palm is given him in that middle
kind of writing.”</p>

<p>This is niggardly praise; and is somewhat similar
to that which the same critic awards to Apollonius
Rhodius;<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> whose picturesque style and impassioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lvii"></a>[lvii]</span>
sentiment are honoured with the diluted commendation
of “an equable mediocrity.” Who that read
the above character would suppose that Hesiod was
at all superior to the gnomic or sententious poets;
such as Theognis or Phocylides? that he had ever
composed his Combat of Giants, or his Ages of Gold
and of Iron?</p>

<p>If the battle of the Titans be Hesiod’s genuine
composition, and if the Shield, as there is reason to
believe, contain authentic extracts from his Heroical
Genealogies, we shall decide that Hesiod, as compared
with Homer, is less rapid; less fervent in
action; less teeming with allusions and comparisons;
but grand, energetic, occasionally vehement and
daring; but more commonly proceeding with a slow
and stately march. In the mental or moral sublime
I consider Hesiod as superior to Homer. The personification
of Prayers in the latter is almost the
only allegory that can be compared with the awful
prosopopeia of Justice, weeping her wrongs at the
feet of the Eternal: while Justice and Modesty, described
as virgins in white raiment, ascending out of
the sight of men into heaven, and the Holy Dæmons,
after having animated the bodies of just men, hovering
round the earth, and keeping watch over human
actions, are equalled by no conceptions in the Iliad
or Odyssey.</p>

<p>Addison, with that squeamish artificial taste which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lviii"></a>[lviii]</span>
distinguishes the age of Anne, as compared with that
of Elizabeth, underrates, as might have been expected,
the vigorous simplicity of Hesiod. But the
strong though simple sketches of the old Ascræan
bard are often more striking than the finished paintings
of the Mantuan. Critics admire the pastoral
board of Virgil’s Corycian husbandman; but there
is a far greater charm in the summer-repast of Hesiod:
so picturesque in its scenery; so patriarchal in its
manners. The winter tempest is a bolder copy of
nature than any thing in the Latin Georgics; more
fresh in colouring; more circumstantiated in detail.
The rising of the north-wind, moving the ocean,
rooting the pines and oaks from the tops of the mountains,
and strewing them along the valleys, and after
a pause, suddenly roaring in its strength through the
depths of the forests; the exquisite circumstances of
life intermingled with the effects of the storm on inanimate
nature; the beasts quaking and grinding their
teeth with cold and famine; shuddering at the snowflakes,
and shrinking into dens and thickets; the old
man bent double with the blast;<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the delicate contrast
of the young virgin, sheltered in a soft chamber
under her mother’s roof, and bathing previously to
her nightly rest, compose a picture wild, romantic,
and interesting in an uncommon degree.</p>

<p>As a legendary mythologist the elegant tale of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lix"></a>[lix]</span>
Pandora, and the Island of the Blessed Spirits, are far
beyond any thing of Ovid, and can only be compared
with Homer: and as a poetical moralist, the strongest
proof of his merit is, that innumerable sentences of
Hesiod, as is well remarked by Voltaire in his “Dictionnaire
Philosophique” have grown into proverbial
axioms. Cicero observes in one of his Epistles; “Let
our dear Lepta learn Hesiod, and have by heart
‘the gods have placed before virtue the sweat of the
brow.’” His plain and downright rules of decency,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
his superstitious saws, and his lumber of names, belong
to the manners of a semi-barbarous village and
the learning of a dark age: his genius and his wisdom
are his own. From that which remains, mutilated
as it obviously is, we may form a judgment of
what he would appear to us, if the whole of his numerous
works, complete and unadulterated by foreign
mixture, were submitted to our observation. <i>Ex
pede Herculem.</i></p>

<p>Fabricius (Bibliotheca Græca) supposes the two latter subjects
to be alluded to as incidental topics in other works of Hesiod.
But the passages quoted by him from Pliny and Plutarch seem
to justify the opinion that they meant to advert to distinct poems.
There is nothing in the works extant which favours the former
idea. Mallows and asphodel are the only herbs mentioned: and
that merely as synonymous with a frugal meal: like the <i>cichorea
levesque malvæ</i> of Horace: nor is there anything medical;
for the passages respecting bathing, children, &amp;c. are mere superstitions,
unconnected with health. Athenæus (book iii.) quotes
some verses as ascribed to Hesiod respecting the fishes fit for
salting; but says they seem to be rather the verses of a cook
than of a poet; and adds that cities are mentioned in them
which were posterior to Hesiod’s time. Lilius Gyraldus states
that the fables of Æsop have been assigned to Hesiod. Plutarch,
indeed, observes that Æsop might himself have profited by
Hesiod’s apologue of the Hawk and the Nightingale; and Quintilian
mentions Hesiod, and not Æsop, as the earliest fabulist;
which passages may have been strained to bear the above meaning.
As to the Greek fables, extant under the name of Æsop,
they are proved to be spurious. See Bentley’s Dissertation on
the Epistles of Phalaris, Themistocles, &amp;c. and the fables of
Æsop.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="SECTION_IV">SECTION IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">ON THE MYTHOLOGY OF HESIOD.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Diogenes Laertius mentions that Pythagoras
feigned to have seen the soul of Hesiod in the
infernal regions, bound to a brazen pillar, and howling
in torture for his false representations of the
Deities: and that of Homer environed with serpents
for the same reason. Plato, in a similar feeling,
excluded both these poets from his ideal republic.
It seems strange that the philosophers should have
failed to perceive that Hesiod and Homer repeated
merely the popular legends of their age; as is abundantly
evident from the style and manner of narration
and allusion throughout their poems.</p>

<p>The following passage of Herodotus has been construed
to mean that they were the absolute inventors
of the Grecian theology; “Whence each of the
Gods came; whether all have continually existed, or
what figures they severally had, was known but
lately; or, if I may so speak, only yesterday; for I
am of opinion that Hesiod and Homer were older
than myself by four hundred years, and not more;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxi"></a>[lxi]</span>
these are they who framed a theogony for the
Greeks, and gave titles to the gods; distinguishing
their honours and functions, and describing their
forms.”</p>

<p>Against such an hypothesis several reasons obviously
present themselves: 1st, A plurality of gods could
scarcely be the production of a single age, much less
of one or two individuals: 2dly, It is not likely that
Greece, which was visited by Ægyptian and Phœnician
colonists at an æra long antecedent to the
age of Homer, should have been destitute of a religious
system: 3dly, It is not credible that a whole
nation, at the suggestion of one or two bards, should
have abandoned this received system in order to adopt
a whole hierarchy of divinities, of whom they had
never before heard.</p>

<p>But the doubt of Herodotus, “whether they have
continually existed,” shows that he merely considered
Hesiod and Homer in the light of collectors and
illustrators of the ancient religion of their country;
and Wesseling accordingly interprets ποιησαντες as
referring to arrangement and description, not invention.
This stupid inference could in fact never have
been drawn, had Herodotus been compared with
himself: as in a preceding passage he says, “Nearly
all the names of the gods have come into Greece from
Ægypt; for I have ascertained it to be a fact that
they are of barbaric extraction.”</p>

<p>Herodotus, however, seems to have been in error,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxii"></a>[lxii]</span>
even as to this position of Hesiod and Homer having
first digested the mythology of Greece into a system:
and as he could not be ignorant that theogonies were
ascribed to poets reputed their elders, such as Musæus
and Orpheus, he was reduced to the alternative
of making these poets their juniors. “Those poets,”
he observes, “who were said to be before them,
were in my opinion after them.”</p>

<p>But Cicero (in Bruto, cap. xviii.) sensibly argues,
“nor can it be doubted that there were poets before
Homer; which may be inferred from the songs described
by him as sung in the banquets of the Phæacians
and the suitors.” Fabricius makes a comment,
that “it cannot be proved from this, that Greek
poems, before Homer, were committed to writing,
and so handed down to posterity.” As if the poems
of Homer himself had been transmitted in any
other manner than by oral tradition!<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The pre-existence of religious rites seems, indeed,
to involve that of poetical cosmogonies and mythological
hymns. Before the invention of letters there
was no other traditionary record, or vehicle of popular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxiii"></a>[lxiii]</span>
instruction, or organ of religious homage and
supplication, than verse: the conclusion follows that
there were both poets anterior to the age of Homer,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
and that these poets were also mythologists.</p>

<p>Pausanias mentions Olen of Lycia; who, he says,
composed very ancient hymns; and who in his hymn
to Lucina, makes her the mother of Love: and he
names Pamphus and Orpheus, as succeeding Olen,
and as also composing hymns to the mythological
Love.</p>

<p>The doubt entertained by Aristotle and Cicero
of the personal existence of Orpheus, neither affects
the antiquity of the name, nor of that system of
theology which bears the title of Orphic. The relics
now extant under that name have, indeed, been
suspected as the forgeries of Onomacritus, the sooth-sayer,
who produced the hymns to the people of
Athens: but Gesner is of opinion that he only altered
the dialect of genuine Orphic remains, on which
he ingrafted his own additions. The fragments which
have come down to us appear certainly from internal
evidence to contain a theology more ancient than that
of Hesiod and Homer; for the nearer it approaches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxiv"></a>[lxiv]</span>
in any of its parts to the religious system of the
Ægyptians, the stronger is the presumptive testimony
of its antiquity.</p>

<p><a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>The Ægyptians held that the world was produced
from Chaos, or Water. They worshipped the Sun,
as Osiris, Hammon, and Horus; the Moon, as Isis;
the Cabiri or Planets, as symbols of invisible divinities.
They had two systems of worship; the one
exoteric or popular, the other esoteric or mystical.
The adoration of the celestial bodies was literal with
the people, and emblematical with the priesthood.
They supposed emanations from divinity to be resident
in the parts of nature; and thus that the sun,
moon, and stars, and the other bodies of the universe,
were animated with a divine spirit or virtue; or
retained portions of a divine essence from good demons
or genii, who dwelt in them: these dæmons had been
inclosed in the bodies of virtuous men; and having
left them, passed into the stars and planets, which
were consequently worshipped as gods. Hence probably
the legend of Hesiod, who supposes the spirits
of men in the golden age to become holy dæmons;
though these dæmons are not sent to the stars, but
hover round the earth and keep watch over the actions
of humankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxv"></a>[lxv]</span></p>

<p>Jablonski, in his Pantheon Ægyptiorum, considers
this stellar theology as resolvable into an astronomical
and Niliacal idolatry. The terrestrial Osiris is the
Nile: the celestial Osiris the Sun, in his zodiacal
progress through the signs that preside over the seasons.
Amon, Jupiter, designates the Sun in the
constellation of Aries. In the vernal equinox he is
Hercules, in the summer solstice Horus or Apollo,
in the winter solstice Harpocrates. Serapis was the
Nile in its period of fertilization, or the autumnal
Sun of the lower hemisphere. Isis was the moon,
the mother of multiform nature; the same also as
Neitha or Minerva, and the causer of the Nile’s inundations.
Tithrambo, Brimo, or Hecate, was Isis
incensed, or the maleficent moon. Bubastis, Diana,
or Latona, was the titular symbol of the New Moon,
and Buto or Latona of the full. The Cabiri, or
Seven Planets, were worshipped as appendants of
the greater gods; thus the planet Venus was the star
of Isis, and the planet Jupiter the star of Osiris.
The dog-headed Anubis, or Mercury, was the celestial
horizon, the guard of the Sun’s gate, and the
follower of Isis or the Moon. The bull Apis was
a living symbol of the Nile; but was supposed to
have been generated in a heifer by the transmission
of celestial fire from the Moon; and was sacred both
to that planet and to the Sun. A living goat was
the symbol of Mendes or Pan; the generative principle
of all nature. These animal types were multiplied;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxvi"></a>[lxvi]</span>
thus a lion figured the Sun; a cow, Isis and
Venus; and a hawk, Osiris. Stones were also made
typical. An obelisk represented the Sun; and seven
columns, such as Pausanias saw in Laconia, the
Planets. They worshipped also Night, the supposed
creative principle of all things, as Athor, Venus,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
or Juno; and Pthas, the Vulcan as well as Minerva
of the Grecians; the masculo-feminine cause and
soul of the world; a pervading infinite spirit, or subtile
ethereal fire, superior to the solar and planetary
orbs; from which emanated terrestrial souls, and to
which they returned. This system may very well be
reconciled with the received theology; as it is not at
all improbable that the subtile and scientific Ægyptians
should have refined upon their original emblems,
by connecting with them a secondary astronomical signification.
In the explication of certain terms, and the
identity and nature of many of the deities, the “Ægyptian
Pantheon” agrees with the “New Analysis.”</p>

<p>Proclus (in Timæum, book i.) mentions a statue
of Neitha or Minerva in a temple at Sais, in Ægypt,
inscribed on the base with hieroglyphical characters
to this effect: “I am whatever things are, whatever
shall be, and whatever have been. None have lifted
up my veil. The fruit which I have brought forth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxvii"></a>[lxvii]</span>
is the Sun.” Notwithstanding the mixed planetary
worship, the Sun was considered by the Ægyptians
as the king and architect of the universe: who under
the name of Osiris comprehended in himself the
power and efficacy of all the other material gods.
Consistent with this is the Orphic fragment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="smcap">Sun</span> all-various! golden-beaming! all things teeming out of thee!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In another passage Orpheus identifies with the sun
the different deities.</p>

<p>The cosmogonists of Ægypt represented the Demiurgus
or Universal Maker, in a human form, sending
forth from his mouth an egg; which egg was the
world. They called him Kneph; who was the same
as Pthas, the essential pervading energy. Chaos is
described by Orpheus, in the manner of Ovid, as
an immense, self-existent, heterogeneous mass; neither
luminous nor tenebrous; which in the lapse of
ages generated an egg; and from this egg was produced
a masculo-feminine principle, which disposed
the elements, and created the forms of nature. A
primæval water or Chaos, and a mundane egg, are
found also in the mythology of India.</p>

<p>In the cosmogonic system of Ægypt the world was
Deity, and its parts other gods; a doctrine equivalent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxviii"></a>[lxviii]</span>
to the το πᾶν of the Stoics; the inherent divinity of
the universe; which Lucan seems to intend in the
sentiment of Cato:</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Whate’er we see, where’er we move, is God.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This system is unfolded in the Orphic hymns:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Jove is the breath of all: the force of quenchless flame:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">His regal body grasps the vast material round:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There fire, earth, air, and wave, and day and night, are found.</div>

<p class="noindent">and in another fragment, preserved by Eusebius:
(Præparat. Evang. iii. 9.)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fire, water, earth, and ether, night and day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Metis, first sire, and all-delighting Love.</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Metis is Minerva or Vulcan, the mind of the universe

<p>From a general view of the Ægyptian and Orphic
theogonies, they would appear to consist in an
atheistic materialism; for although they acknowledge
a certain divine, or active, principle pervading and
animating passive matter, nothing can be inferred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxix"></a>[lxix]</span>
from this, superior to a physical operative energy.
Jablonski indeed contends that, exclusive of the
worship of the signs of the zodiac, and the solar and
lunar phenomena, the more ancient Ægyptians recognized
an <i>intelligent</i> power, or infinite Eternal Mind,
on whose wisdom the operations of the <i>sensible</i> or
visible divinities depended. But it may be doubted
whether this controlling intelligence were any thing
different from the before described emanation of the
supposed ethereal spirit of holy dæmons, or deified
men.</p>

<p>Hesiod begins his poem on the generation of the
gods with certain cosmogonical principles. Chaos
first exists; then Earth; and thirdly Love. Erebus
and Night spring from Chaos, and generate Ether
and Day; and Earth produces Heaven. But we
search in vain through the rest of the work for the
subtile intelligence of the Orphic philosophy. It has
been attempted, indeed, to reduce the whole into
a consistent scheme of theogonic physiology, by
allegorizing the supernatural battles into volcanic
eruptions, hurricanes, and earthquakes; but much
would still remain incapable of being wrested to a
physical sense. On certain crude principles of cosmogonical
tradition, and lineal generations of gods,
intermingled with the generation of the world, the
theogonist has ingrafted ancient legendary histories,
and poetical and moral allegories. The historical
mythology is alone significant; for every thing respecting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxx"></a>[lxx]</span>
the nature of the gods was in Hesiod’s time
perverted and misunderstood. The bard was no
longer clothed in the robe of the hierophant.</p>

<p>Very different hypotheses have been framed to explain
the Greek polytheism. They have failed <i>because</i>
they were hypotheses. When the Abbé Banier<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> detects
the real characters of profane history in the
gods of the Pantheon; and when De Gebelin<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> sees
in them only emblematical shadows, personifying the
successive inventions of the sciences and arts, we are
reminded of the observation of Dr. Reid; (Essays on
the Intellectual Powers of Man:) “that there never
was an hypothesis invented by an ingenious man,
which although destitute of direct evidence, did not
serve to account for a variety of phenomena, and
had not therefore an indirect evidence in its favour.”
Even the Alchemists have laid claim to the heathen
mythology; the pagan stories have been analysed into
chemical arcana: the golden fleece becomes a recipe
for the discovery of the philosopher’s stone inscribed
on a ram’s-skin, and Medea restores her father to life
by means of the grand elixir.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>But it were an unreasonable scepticism to argue
from these visionary theories, that the ancient fabulous
philosophy is a mass of inscrutable and unmeaning
superstition. The affinity between the different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxi"></a>[lxxi]</span>
systems of paganism rests on irrefutable proof.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> This
affinity points to a common origin. The light of
history directs us to Ægypt. The astronomical
genius of that nation led them to symbolize their
idols by the celestial signs. These idols were the
deified memories of men. As to their individuality,
we are assisted by certain resemblances in heathen
theology to Mosaic scripture. This parallel may
have been urged too closely and too fancifully; as by
Huet, in his “Demonstratio Evangelica:” who
affirms that all the deities of the Ægyptians, Indians,
Americans, Greeks, and Italians, are only Moses in
disguise; and by Theophilus Gale, in his “Court
of the Gentiles;” who draws a parallel between the
god Pan, and the Messias, Abel, and Israel; and
who derives not only both the mythic or fabulous,
and the physical theology of the heathens, but all
human letters and sciences from the Hebrew language
and scriptures, and the philosophies of
Joseph, Moses, and Solomon. Mistakes may have
arisen from trusting too much to a specious analogy;
as where Tubal-cain, the artificer of brass and iron,
is identified with Vulcan.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The conjectures of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxii"></a>[lxxii]</span>
Hebraic etymologists, also, as of Bochart, in the
Phaleg and Canaan of his Geographia sacra, must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxiii"></a>[lxxiii]</span>
be acknowledged to be often vague and inconclusive.
But so plain are the general traces of corrupted
scripture-history, that Celsus, in his books against
the Christians, attacks the biblical records as plagiarisms
from the pagan mythology; and asserts that
Paradise is borrowed from the gardens of Alcinous,
and the flood of Noah from that of Deucalion; which
Origen refutes by the greater antiquity of the Jewish
traditions.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that they, who trace these
parallels of mythology with scripture, mean that
scripture was its immediate source: as the French
Encyclopædists seem to think, when they ridicule the
idea of the Grecian poets having deduced their fables
from the Mosaic books, of which they knew nothing.
The religious separation of the Jews renders it improbable,
that even the intellectual philosophy of the
Greek sages, as Thales and Pythagoras, should have
been indebted for the idea of pure incorporeal deity
to the sacred oracles: though Dr. Anderson conceives
it probable that “the Mosaic scriptures, and
other prophetical writings under the Jewish dispensation,
could not be unknown to the priests of Ægypt,
Chaldæa, and other adjacent countries.” History of
Philosophy, p. 88.</p>

<p>But the improbability is greatly increased with respect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxiv"></a>[lxxiv]</span>
to the mythological philosophy; nor is it credible
that the circumstances of pagan story, on the
supposition of their representing the same events as
those recorded in the book of Genesis, should have
been transferred immediately from the volume of
Moses by poets or philosophers into the popular religion.
Nations do not borrow vast systems of theology
from poets or even from priests. Gale does not
suppose that priests or bards imported the Hebrew
accounts from the sacred writings; but that they were
learnt, through international communication with the
Jews, by the Phœnicians; who, in their various nautical
enterprizes, carried them to distant countries.</p>

<p>But the temple of heathen mythology rests its
pillars in the two hemispheres, and overshadows
climes unvisited by the navigators of Phœnicia. Its
basis must, apparently, be sought without the circle
of Jewish report and scripture, in ancient gentile tradition.
Stillingfleet convincingly argues, that, assuming
the descent of mankind from the posterity of
Noah, the obliteration and extinction of all remnants
of oral history concerning the ancient world is utterly
inconceivable. He proceeds to show that such fragments
were, in fact, so preserved in many nations
after the dispersion; that they were appropriated by
the Phœnicians, Greeks, Italians, and others to their
respective countries; and that portions of Noah’s
memory, in particular, were retained in many fables
under Saturn, Janus, Prometheus, and Bacchus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxv"></a>[lxxv]</span></p>

<p>Similar to this is the outline of the Analytic System;
in which, however, the dæmon-worship of the patriarchs
of mankind is connected with the arkite and
ophite idolatry under the types of the sun and moon.
The affinities in the pagan sister-mythologies are explained
by the general dissemination of these idolatrous
mysteries, and the traditions which they were
designed to commemorate, through the dispersion of
a peculiar people in the early ages; migrating from a
central point, and spreading through the extremest
regions of the east and west.</p>

<p>“This wonderful people were the descendants of
Chus; and called Cuthites and Cuseans. They stood
their ground at the general migration of families, but
were at last scattered over the face of the earth. They
were the first apostates from the truth, yet great in
worldly wisdom. They introduced, wherever they
came, many useful arts, and were looked up to as a
superior order of beings. They were joined in their
expeditions by other nations; especially by the collateral
branches of their family; the Mizraim, Caphtorim,
and the sons of Canaän. These were all of
the line of Ham, who was held by his posterity in
the highest veneration. They called him Amon; and
having in process of time raised him to a divinity,
they worshipped him as the Sun; and from this worship
they were called Amonians. Under this denomination
are included all of this family; whether they
were Ægyptians or Syrians, of Phœnicia or of Canaän.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxvi"></a>[lxxvi]</span>
They were a people who carefully preserved
memorials of their ancestors, and of those great events
which had preceded their dispersion. These were described
in hieroglyphics on pillars and obelisks.</p>

<p>“The deity whom they originally worshipped was
the Sun; but they soon conferred his titles upon
some other of their ancestors; whence arose a mixed
worship. Chus was one of these; and the idolatry
began among his sons. The same was practised by
the Ægyptians; but this nation made many subtile
distinctions; and supposing that there were certain
emanations of divinity, they affected to particularize
each by some title, and to worship the deity by his
attributes. This gave rise to a multiplicity of gods.
The Grecians, who received their religion from
Ægypt and the East, misapplied the terms which
they had received, and made a god out of every title.”

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> The working of metals was not among the ancient attributes
of Vulcan: but a diversity of character or attributes is not
always an objection. Each god had not only a twofold nature,
celestial, and human or heroical, but his history and qualities
changed with change of place. Thus Hercules was the Sun; he
was also a vagabond hero; but he may have been one person in
Greece, and another in Phœnicia. Gerard Vossius, in his
treatise “de Origine et Progressu Idolatriæ,” may therefore be
right in his conjecture, that among the Phœnicians both Joshua
and Samson were commemorated in the Tyrian Hercules. Bacchus
was the Sun, and an Indian conqueror. His history also assimilates
with that of Noah. He was likewise in all probability
Caphtor, the grandson of Ham; the great Ægyptian warrior who
dispossessed the Avim of that part of the land of Canaan, afterwards
called Philistia. (See Priestley’s Lectures on History, i. 5.)
But it is natural that the Phœnicians, who visited Greece when
the memory of Moses was still vivid among the Canaanites,
should have brought with them miraculous reports of the Jewish
lawgiver, which were added to the history of Bacchus. Bacchus
is called by Orpheus, Μισης; and by Plutarch (de Iside et Osiride)
Palæstinus. Bacchus was exposed in an ark upon a river: a
double coincidence with Noah and Moses, which is exactly in the
spirit of the old mythologists. Nonnus, in his Dionysiacs, mentions
the flight of Bacchus to the red sea, and his battles with
the Princes of Arabia; and relates that he touched the rivers
Orontes and Hydaspes with his thyrsus, and that the rivers dried
up, and he passed through dry-shod. The Indians are in darkness,
while the Bacchic army are in light. The ivy-rod of Bacchus
is thrown on the ground, and creeps to and fro like a live
serpent. Snakes twist themselves about the hair and limbs of
Bacchus; which may be a shadow of the fiery serpents in the
wilderness. The host of Bacchus, like the multitude led by
Moses, is accompanied by women. One of the Bacchæ touches
a rock, and water gushes out; at another time wine and honey;
and the rivers run with milk. These circumstances are very remarkable.

<h3>The Argument.</h3>

<p>The poem comprehends the general œconomy of industry and
morals. In the first division of the subject, the state of the
world, past and present, is described; for the purpose of exemplifying
the condition of human nature: which entails on
man the necessity of exertion to preserve the goods of life;
and leaves him no alternative but honest industry or unjust
violence; of which the good and evil consequences are respectively
illustrated. <span class="smcap">Two Strifes</span> are said to have been sent
into the world, the one promoting dissension, the other emulation.
Perses is exhorted to abjure the former and embrace
the latter; and an apposite allusion is made to the circumstance
of his litigiously disputing the patrimonial estate, of
which, through the corruption of the judges, he obtained the
larger proportion. The judges are rebuked, and cheap contentment
is apostrophized as the true secret of happiness.
Such is stated to have been the original sense of mankind
before the necessity of labour existed. The origin of labour
is deduced from the resentment of Jupiter against Prometheus;
which resentment led to the formation of <span class="smcap">Pandora</span>: or
<span class="smcap">Woman</span>: who is described with her attributes, and is represented
as bringing with her into the world a casket of diseases.
The degeneracy of man is then traced through successive ages.
The three first ages are severally distinguished as the golden,
the silver, and the brazen. The fourth has no metallic distinction,
but is described as the heroic age, and as embracing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
the æra of the Trojan war. The fifth is styled the iron age,
and, according to the Poet, is that in which he lives. The
general corruption of mankind in this age is detailed, and
Modesty and Justice are represented taking their flight to heaven.
A pointed allusion to the corrupt administration of the
laws, in his own particular instance, is introduced in a fable,
typical of oppression. Justice is described as invisibly following
those who violate her decrees with avenging power, and
as lamenting in their streets the wickedness of a corrupted
people. The temporal blessings of an upright nation are contrasted
with the temporal evils which a wicked nation draws
down from an angry Providence. Holy Dæmons are represented
as hovering about the earth, and keeping watch over
the actions of men. Justice is again introduced, carrying her
complaints to the feet of Jupiter, and obtaining that the crimes
of rulers be visited on their people. A pathetic appeal is then
made to these rulers in their judicial capacity, urging them to
renounce injustice. After some further exhortations to virtue
and industry, and a number of unconnected precepts, the
Poet enters on the <span class="smcap">Georgical</span> part of his subject: which
contains the prognostics of the seasons of agricultural labour,
and rules appertaining to wood-felling, carpentry, ploughing,
sowing, reaping, threshing, vine-dressing, and the vintage.
This division of the subject includes a description of winter
and of a repast in summer. He then treats of navigation:
and concludes with some desultory precepts of religion, moral
decorum, and superstition: and lastly, with a specification of
<span class="smcap">Days</span>: which are divided into holy, auspicious, and inauspicious:
mixed and intermediary: or such as are entitled to no
remarkable observance.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> <i>The bowed feeble rears.</i>] This proem was wanting in the leaden-sheeted
copy, seen by Pausanias in Bœotia. The affinity with
scriptural language is remarkable. “The Lord maketh poor
and maketh rich: he bringeth low and lifteth up. He raiseth up
the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dung-hill
to set him among princes.” Samuel v. 1, ch. 2. “God is the
judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another. The
Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up them that be bowed
down. The Lord lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked
down to the ground.” Psalms 75, 145, 147. I was originally
led to suspect that this introduction had been ingrafted on the
poem by one of the Alexandrian Jews; who were addicted to
this kind of imposture; but it is probably more ancient than the
establishment of the Jewish colony at Alexandria, under the
Ptolemies. There is nothing conclusive to be drawn from coincidences
of this sort between ancient writings. The first principles
of morality, implanted in the human heart by its author,
have in all ages been the same: and Socrates and Confucius
might be found to agree, surely without any suspicion of imitation.
Many passages of Hesiod may be paralleled with
verses in the Psalms and Proverbs: and in the proem under
consideration, there seem no grounds for the conjecture of
plagiarism from views of the vicissitudes of human condition,
and the ordinations of a ruling providence which are continually
passing before our eyes, and which must have struck the reasoning
and serious part of mankind in all ages. Horace has a similar
passage: b. i. od. 34.</p>

from ευφρονεω, to be wise. She was the mother of wise designs,

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> <i>Almsmen zealous throng.</i>] The proximity of the beggar to the
bard might in a modern writer convey a satirical innuendo, of
which Hesiod cannot be suspected. The bard, as is evident from
Homer’s Odyssey, enjoyed a sort of conventional hospitality,
bestowed with reverence and affection. It should seem, however,
from this passage that the asker of alms was not regarded
in the light of a common mendicant with us. It was a popular
superstition that the gods often assumed similar characters for
the purpose of trying the benevolence of men. A noble incentive
to charity, which indicates the hospitable character of a
semi-barbarous age.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">[31]</a> <i>The good which asphodel and mallows yield.</i>] A similar sentiment
occurs in the Proverbs: “Better is a dinner of herbs
where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.” Ch. 15.
v. 17.</p>

<p>Plutarch in the “Banquet of the Seven Sages,” observes,
that “the herb mallows is good for food, as is the sweet stalk of
the asphodel or daffodil.” These plants were often used by
metonymy for a frugal table. Homer (Odyssey 24.) places the
shades of the blessed in meadows of asphodel, because they
were supposed to be restored to the state of primitive innocence,
when men were contented with the simple and spontaneous aliment
of the ground. Perhaps the Greeks had this allusion
in their custom of planting the asphodel in the cemeteries,
and also burying it with the bodies of the dead. It appears
from Pliny, b. xxii. c. 22. that Hesiod had treated of the asphodel
in some other work: as he is said to have spoken of it as a
native of the woods.</p>

to refine with needless subtleties on plain passages. Le Clerc
explains this to mean that “in one day’s fishing you might have
caught such an abundance of fish, as to allow of the rudder being
laid by for a long interval.” The common sense of the passage,
however, is that, were the former state of existence renewed,
the rudder, which it was customary after a voyage to hang up in
the smoke, might remain there for ever. You needed not have
crossed the sea for merchandise. The custom of suspending the
helms of ships in chimneys, to preserve them from decay, is adverted
to again among the nautical precepts.</p>

provoked the wrath of Jupiter was the sacrifice of bones mentioned
in the Theogony.</p>

<p>It would appear extraordinary that the crime of Prometheus,
who was a god, should be visited on man. This injustice betrays
the real character of Prometheus; that he was a deified
mortal. If Prometheus, the maker of man according to Ovid,
and his divine benefactor according to Hesiod, be in reality
Noah, as many circumstances concur to prove, the concealment
of fire by Jupiter might be a type of the darkness and dreariness
of nature during the interval of the deluge; and the recovery of
the flame might signify the renovation of light and fertility and
the restitution of the arts of life.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="label">[35]</a> <i>An ill which all shall love.</i>] In the scholia of Olympiodorus
on Plato, Pandora is allegorized into the irrational soul or
sensuality: as opposed to intellect. By Heinsius she is supposed
to be Fortune. But there never was less occasion for
straining after philosophical mysteries. Hesiod asserts in plain
terms, that Pandora is the mother of woman; he tells us she
brought with her a casket of diseases; and that through her the
state of man became a state of labour, and his longevity was
abridged. It is an ancient Asiatic legend; and Pandora is plainly
the Eve of Mosaic history. How this primitive tradition came to
be connected with that of the deluge is easily explained. “Time
with the ancients,” observes Mr. Bryant, “commenced at the
deluge; all their traditions and genealogies terminated here. The
birth of mankind went with them no higher than this epocha.”
We see here a confusion of events, of periods, and of characters.
The fall of man to a condition of labour, disease, and
death is made subsequent to the flood; because the great father
of the post-diluvian world was regarded as the original father of
mankind.</p>

arguing that μῆλα are, in this place, fruits of any trees; as
arbutes, figs, nuts; and not flocks: but his arguments respecting
the food of primitive mankind are drawn from the conceptions
of modern poets; such as Lucretius and Ovid. The traditionary
age described by Hesiod was a shepherd age. Flocks
are the most ancient symbol of prosperity, and are often synonymous
with riches and dominion.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="label">[43]</a> <i>High Jove as dæmons raised them from the ground.</i>] In the
account of this age we have a just history of the rise of idolatry;
when deified men had first divine honours paid to them; and we
may be assured of the family in which it began; as what was
termed Crusean, the <i>golden</i> race, should have been expressed
Cusean; for it relates to the age of Chus, and the denomination
of his sons. This substitution was the cause of the other divisions
being introduced; that each age might be distinguished in
succession by one of baser metal. Had there been no mistake
about a golden age, we should never have been treated with one
of silver; much less with the subsequent of brass and iron. The
original history relates to the patriarchic age, when the time of
man’s life was not yet abridged to its present standard, and
when the love of rule and acts of violence first displayed themselves
on the earth. The Amonians, wherever they settled,
carried these traditions along with them, which were thus added
to the history of the country; so that the scene of action was
changed. A colony who styled themselves Saturnians came to
Italy, and greatly benefited the natives. But the ancients, who
generally speak collectively in the singular, and instead of Herculeans
introduce Hercules; instead of Cadmians, Cadmus; suppose
a single person, Saturn, to have betaken himself to this
country. Virgil mentions the story in this light, and speaks of
Saturn’s settling there; and of the rude state of the nation upon
his arrival; where he introduced an age of gold. Æn. viii. 314.
The account is confused; yet we may discern in it a true history
of the first ages, as may be observed likewise in Hesiod. Both
the poets, however the scene may be varied, allude to the happy
times immediately after the deluge; when the great patriarch
had full power over his descendants, and equity prevailed without
written law. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45" class="label">[45]</a> <i>The wealth of fields.</i>] Heinsius quotes Hesychius to show that
πλοῦτος does not always mean riches, properly so called; but the
riches of the soil: and says that it is here applied to the good dæmons
as presiding over the productions of the seasons. Bacchus,
in the Lenæan rites, was invoked by the epithet πλουτοδοτης,
wealth-bestower; in allusion to the vineyard. It seems intimated
here, that the Spirits reward the deeds of the just by
abundant harvests; the common belief of the Greeks, as appears
both from Hesiod and Homer.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_46" href="#FNanchor_46" class="label">[46]</a> <i>A hundred years.</i>] Heinsius explains this passage to mean,
that “although this age was indeed deteriorated from the former,
this much of good remained; that the boys were not early exposed
to the contagion of vice, but long participated the chaste
and retired education of their sisters in the seclusion of the
female apartments.” Grævius, on the contrary, insists that
Hesiod notes it as a mark of depravation, that the youth were
educated in sloth and effeminacy, and grew up, as it were, on
the lap of their mothers. These two opinions are about
equally to the purpose. [“The poet manifestly alludes to the longevity
of persons in the patriarchic age: for they did not, it
seems, die at three-score and ten, but took more time even in
advancing towards puberty. He speaks, however, of their being
cut off in their prime; and whatever portion of life nature might
have allotted to them, they were abridged of it by their own
folly and injustice.”] <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="label">[47]</a> <i>To Troy’s far shore.</i>] Dr. Clarke in his travels in Greece,
Egypt, and the Holy-land, has noticed that the existence of Troy,
and the facts relative to the Trojan war, are supported by a
variety of evidence independent of Homer: as has been abundantly
shown in the course of the controversy between Mr.
Bryant and his able antagonist, Mr. Morritt. This passage of
Hesiod seems to me decisive testimony. If Hesiod be older
than Homer, as is computed by the chronicler of the Parian
Marbles, it is self-evident that the Trojan war is not of Homeric
invention: and if they were contemporary, or even if Hesiod,
according to the vulgar chronology, were really junior by a century,
it is not at all probable that he should have copied the
fiction of another bard, while tracing the primitive history of
mankind. He manifestly used the ancient traditions of his
nation, of which the war of Troy was one.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="label">[48]</a> <i>In those blest isles.</i>] Pindar also alludes to these in his second

    <div class="verse indent2">Through the islands of the blessed blow.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As the life of these beatified heroes was a renewal of that in
the golden age, it is figured by the reign of Saturn or Cronus:
the father of post-diluvian time. The era in which, after the
waste of the deluge, the vine was planted and corn again sown,
was represented by tradition as a time of wonderful abundance
and fruitfulness. Hence apparently the fable of the Elysian
fields: which some have supposed to originate from the reports
of voyagers, who had visited distant fertile regions. Saturn is
usually placed in Tartarus: but Tartarus meant the west: from
the association of darkness with sunset: and the Blessed Islands
were the Fortunate Isles on the Western Coast of Afric.</p>

<p>“These heroes, whose equity is so much spoken of, upon a
nearer inquiry are found to be continually engaged in wars and
murders; and like the specimens exhibited of the former ages,
are finally cut off by each other’s hands in acts of robbery and
violence: some for stealing sheep, others for carrying away the
wives of their friends and neighbours. Such was the end of
these laudable banditti: of whom Jupiter, we are told, had so
high an opinion, that after they had plundered and butchered one
another, he sent them to the island of the Blest to partake of
perpetual felicity.” <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

gray</i>.” Postquam <i>facti</i> circa tempora cani <i>fuerint</i>: but the
proper interpretation is, quum vix <i>nati</i> canescant: as Grævius
has corrected it. The same critic is unquestionably right in his
opinion, that the future tenses of this passage in the original are
to be understood as indefinite present: μεμψονται, incusabunt:
<i>i. e.</i> incusare solent: <i>use</i> to revile.</p>

<p>Mark, iii. 27. και τοτε την οικιᾶν αυτου διαρπασει: “and then he will
spoil his house:” that is, he is accustomed to spoil. The imperfect
time has also frequently the same acceptation: as in the
same evangelist: ch. xiv. 12. το πασχα εθυον, they <i>killed</i> the passover:
they are used to kill it.</p>

in the early times of Greece, a magistrate. The kings against
whom Hesiod inveighs, are therefore simply a kind of nobles,

<p><a id="Footnote_54" href="#FNanchor_54" class="label">[54]</a> <i>A neck-streak’d nightingale.</i>] Ποικιλοδειρον, with variegated
throat. This has not been thought appropriate to the nightingale.
Tzetzes and Moschopolus interpreted the term by ποικιλοφωνον,
with varied voice; a very forced construction; yet it is
adopted by Loesner, who renders it by <i>canoram</i>. Ruhnken proposes
the emendation of ποικιλογηρυν, which is synonymous. Others
have doubted whether αηδων, which is literally <i>singer</i>, might not
apply to some other bird, as the thrush, which is defined by Linnæus,
“back brown, neck spotted with white.” But the name
<i>singer</i> might have been applied to the nightingale by way of eminence.
In fact I see no difficulty. Linnæus, indeed, describes
the nightingale, “bill brown, head and back pale mouse-colour,
with olive spots,” and says nothing of the throat. Simonides,
however, speaks of χλοραυχενες αειδονες, <i>green-necked</i> nightingales,
which might justify Hesiod’s epithet. Bewick in the “British
Birds” thus describes the <i>luscinia</i>: “the whole upper part of the
body of a rusty brown tinged with olive; under parts pale ash-colour;
<i>almost white at the throat</i>.” A more ancient ornithologist
has a description still more nearly approximating to the term of
Hesiod; and it seems evident that there is more than one species
of nightingale.</p>

<p>“Luscinia, philomela, αηδων.</p>

<p>“The nightingale is about the bigness of a goldfinch. The colour
on the upper part, <i>i. e</i>. the head and back, is a pale fulvous
(lion, or deep gold colour) with a certain mixture of green, like
that of a red-wing. Its tail is of a deeper fulvous or red, like a
red-start’s. From its red colour it took the name of <i>rossignuolo</i>,
in Italian: (<i>rossignol</i>, French). The belly is white. The parts
under the wings, breast, and <i>throat</i>, are of a darker colour, with
<i>a tincture of green</i>.” <span class="smcap">Willoughby’s Ornithology</span>, fol. 1678.</p>

of <i>rue</i>: thus the meaning would be, “that he might then,
at that instant, punish the sins of the judges.” Never was an
interference with the text so little called for. The meaning which
Theobald is so scrupulous to admit is exactly conformable with
that of a preceding passage:</p>

<p>In the words of Hesiod there
is made mention of one rising of the Pleiads, which is heliacal, and
of a double setting: the time of the rising may be referred to the
11th of May. The first setting, which indicated ploughing-time,
was <i>cosmical</i>; when, as the sun rises, the Pleiads sink below the
opposite horizon, which, in the time of Hesiod, happened about the
beginning of November. The second setting is somewhat obscurely
designated in the line</p>

<p class="noindent">and is the <i>heliacal</i> setting, which happened the third of April,
and after which the Pleiads were immerged in the sun’s splendour
forty days. Hesiod, however, speaks as if he confounded the
two settings, for no one would suppose but that the first-mentioned
setting was that after which the Pleiads are said to be
hidden previous to the harvest. But his words are to be explained
with more indulgence, since he could not be ignorant of
the time that intervened between the season of ploughing and
that of harvest. <span class="smcap">Le Clerc.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_79" href="#FNanchor_79" class="label">[79]</a> <i>’Tis time to sow.</i>] In the original, begin <i>ploughing</i>; by which
is meant the last ploughing, when they turned up the soil to receive
the seed. Thus Virgil, Georg. 1:</p>

</div>

<p>Heyne observes, “they sink below the region of the West, at
the same time that the sun emerges from the East;” the <i>cosmical</i>
setting described by Hesiod. The receding of the bright
star of the crown of Ariadne, which Virgil mentions, is its receding
from the sun; that is, its heliacal rising.</p>

<p>The heliacal rising is a star’s emersion out of the sun’s rays;
that is, a star rises heliacally when, having been in conjunction
with the sun, the sun passes it and recedes from it. The star
then emerges out of the sun’s rays so far that it becomes again
visible, after having been for some time lost in the superiority of
day-light. The time of day in which the star rises heliacally is
at the dawn of day; it is then seen for a few minutes near the
horizon, just out of the reach of the morning light; and it rises in
a double sense from the horizon and from the sun’s rays. Afterwards,
as the sun’s distance increases, it is seen more and more
every morning.</p>

<p>The heliacal rising and setting is then, properly, an apparition
and occultation. With respect to the Pleiads, it appears
that different authors vary in fixing the duration of their occultation
from about thirty-one days to above forty.</p>

<p>In a note by Holdsworth on Warton’s Georgics, it is observed
that the <i>heliacal</i> setting of these stars is pointed out by the word
<i>abscondantur</i>. But this is a contradiction; for <i>Eoæ absconduntur</i>
is the same as <i>occidunt matutinæ</i>, set in the morning; but the
time of day in which a star sets heliacally is in the evening, just
after sun-set, when it is seen only for a few minutes in the west
near the horizon, on the edge of the sun’s splendour, into which
in a few days more it sinks.</p>

<p>Servius explains the meaning to be, that he should plough and
sow “in fair weather, when it was so hot as to make clothing
superfluous.” This seems to be very idle advice, and fixes on
Virgil the imputation of a truism. An equally superfluous counsel
is ascribed by Robinson and Grævius to Hesiod. We are
correctly told that both γυμνος and <i>nudus</i> applied to men who had
laid aside their upper garment, whether the <i>pallia</i> or <i>toga</i>, the Grecian
cloak or the Roman gown; and thus is explained the passage
in Matthew, xxiv. 18: “Neither let him which is in the field return
back to take his clothes:” but as no husbandman, whether
Greek or Italian, unless insane, would dream of following the
plough in a trailing cloak, Hesiod may safely be acquitted of so
unnecessary a piece of advice. In the hot climates of Greece and
Italy, it was probably the custom for active husbandmen to bare
the upper part of their bodies. Virgil does not say “Plough in
fine weather and not in winter;” but “Plough with your best diligence,
for winter will soon be here:” equivalent to Hesiod’s
“Summer will not last for ever.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_87" href="#FNanchor_87" class="label">[87]</a> <i>The shrill crane’s migratory cry.</i>] The cranes generally leave
Europe for a more southern climate about the latter end of autumn;
and return in the beginning of summer. Their cry is the
loudest among birds; and although they soar to such a height as
to be invisible, it is distinctly heard. It is often a prognostic of
rain: as from the immense altitude of their ascent they are peculiarly
susceptible of the motions and changes of the atmosphere:
but Tzetzes is mistaken in supposing that the migratory
cry of the crane denotes only its sensibility of cold. These migrations
are performed in the night-time, and in numerous bodies;
and the clangous scream, alluded to by Hesiod, is of use to
govern their course. By this cry they are kept together; are
directed to descend upon the corn-fields, the favourite scene of
their depredations, and to betake themselves again to flight in case
of alarm. Though they soar above the reach of sight they can,
themselves, clearly distinguish every thing upon the earth beneath
them. See “Goldsmith’s Animated Nature.” Virgil
notices the crane’s instinct as to rain, Georg. i. 375:</p>

says, ειαρι πολειν: turn the soil in spring; of the second, θερεος
νεωμενη, ploughed again in summer; the summer tilth: of the
third αροτον: by which he invariably means the seed-ploughing,
when they both ploughed up and sowed the ground.

<p>The ploughing first mentioned by Hesiod is, then, actually the
last. It appears that he recommends ground to be twi-fallowed:
or prepared twice by ploughing before the seed-ploughing. Virgil
directs it to be tri-fallowed, Georg. i. 47:</p>

<p>Fallowing, or ploughing the soil while at rest from yielding a
crop, prepares it for the growth of seed by pulverizing it, exposing
it to the influences of the atmosphere, and destroying the
weeds: and is of essential use in recovering land that had been
impoverished and exhausted by a succession of the same crops.
The practice of fallows seems, however, to be now in a great
degree superseded by that of an interchange of other crops in
rotation; and the succession of green or leguminous plants alternately
with the white crops or grain: the frequent hoeings, in
this mode of tillage, cleaning the soil no less effectually than
fallowings.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_101" href="#FNanchor_101" class="label">[101]</a> <i>Now gnaws the boneless polypus his feet.</i>] Athenæus, book vii.
explodes the notion of the polypus gnawing its own feet, and
states that its feet are so injured by the congers or sea-eels.
Pliny accounts for the mutilation in rather a marvellous manner.
“They are ravenously fond of oysters: these, at the touch,
close their shell, and cutting off the claws of the polypus take
their food from their plunderer. The polypi, therefore, lie in
wait for them when they are open; and placing a little stone, so
as not to touch the body of the oyster, and so as not to be
ejected by the muscular motion of the shell, assail them in security
and extract the flesh. The oyster contracts itself, but to
no purpose, having been thus wedged open.” Lib. ix. c. 30.</p>

<p>The same story has been told, with greater probability, of the
monkey. “The name of polypi has been peculiarly ascribed to
these animals by the ancients, because of the number of feelers
or feet of which they are all possessed, and with which they
have a slow progressive motion: but the moderns have given the
name of polypus to a reptile that lives in fresh water, by no
means so large or observable. These are found at the bottom of
wet ditches, or attached to the under-surface of the broad-leaved
plants that grow and swim on the waters. The same difference
holds between these and the sea-water polypi, as between all
the productions of the land and the ocean. The marine vegetables
and animals grow to a monstrous size. The eel, the
pike, or the bream of fresh waters is but small: in the sea they
grow to an enormous magnitude. It is so between the polypi of
both elements. Those of the sea are found from two feet in
length to three or four: and Pliny has even described one, the
arms of which were no less than thirty feet long. The polypus
contracts itself more or less in proportion as it is touched, or as
the water is agitated in which they are seen. Warmth animates
them, and cold benumbs them: but it requires a degree of cold
approaching congelation, before they are reduced to perfect inactivity.
The arms, when the animal is not disturbed, and the
season is not unfavourable, are thrown about in various directions
in order to seize and entangle its prey. Sometimes three or four
of the arms are thus employed; while the rest are contracted,
like the horns of a snail, within the animal’s body. It seems
capable of giving what length it pleases to these arms: it contracts
and extends them at pleasure; and stretches them only
in proportion to the remoteness of the object it would seize.
Some of these animals so strongly resemble a flowering vegetable
in their forms, that they have been mistaken for such by many
naturalists. Mr. Hughes, the author of the Natural History
of Barbadoes, has described a species of this animal, but has
mistaken its nature, and called it a sensitive flowering plant. He
observed it to take refuge in the holes of rocks, and, when undisturbed,
to spread forth a number of ramifications, each terminated
by a flowery petal, which shrunk at the approach of the hand,
and withdrew into the hole from which it had before been seen to
issue. This plant, however, was no other than an animal of
the polypus kind: which is not only to be found in Barbadoes,
but also on many parts of the coast of Cornwall, and along the
shores of the Continent.” <span class="smcap">Goldsmith</span>, <span class="smcap">Animated Nature</span>,

<p>Eustathius tells us, that in after-times they gave the same

to Ulysses a cap such as they then used. Thus as the club is the
badge of Hercules, so is the cap of Ulysses: as appears from
coins and other antiques. The ancient Greeks did not use any
covering for the head: and it was from them that the Romans
borrowed the custom of going bare-headed. They used caps
only on journeys; in excessive heat or cold; or in rainy weather.
These caps the Latins called <i>petasos</i>: they were a kind of broad-brimmed
hat, like that which is observed in the figures of Mercury.
Otherwise, when in the city, they merely wrapped their

one when the star rises exactly as the sun sets, and sets exactly
as the sun rises. This is the <i>true</i> acronychal rising and
setting, but it is invisible by reason of the day-light. The other
is the visible or <i>apparent</i> acronychal rising and setting; which is,

speaks of the cicada as having a sweet note; but of these epithets
the first is properly <i>vocal</i> or <i>sonorous</i>, and the second <i>shrill</i>
or <i>stridulous</i>. Anacreon calls the insect “wise in music,” but
he seems to think the note musical from its cheerful association
with summer:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Mortals honour thee with praise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prophet sweet of summer days.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Virgil applies to it the characteristics of <i>hoarse</i> and <i>querulous</i>.
Ecl. ii. Georgic. iii.</p>

<p>“Of this genus the most common European species is the
<i>cicada plebeia</i> of Linnæus. This is the insect so often commemorated
by the ancient poets; and generally confounded by
the major part of translators with the grasshopper. It is a native
of the warmer parts of Europe, and particularly of Italy and
Greece: appearing in the latter months of summer, and continuing
its shrill chirping during the greatest part of the day:
generally sitting among the leaves of trees. Notwithstanding the
romantic attestations in honour of the cicada, it is certain that
modern ears are offended rather than pleased with its voice;
which is so very strong and stridulous, that it fatigues by its incessant
repetition; and a single cicada, hung up in a cage, has
been found to drown the voice of a whole company. The male
cicada alone exerts this powerful note, the female being entirely
mute. That a sound so piercing should proceed from so small a
body may well excite our astonishment; and the curious apparatus,
by which it is produced, has justly claimed the attention
of the most celebrated investigators. Reaumur and Roësel, in
particular, have endeavoured to ascertain the nature of the mechanism
by which the noise is produced; and have found that
it proceeds from a pair of concave membranes, seated on each
side of the first joints of the abdomen: the large concavities of
the abdomen, immediately under the two broad <i>lamellæ</i> in the
male insect, are also faced by a thin, pellucid, iridescent membrane,
serving to increase and reverberate the sound; and a
strong muscular apparatus is exerted for the purpose of moving
the necessary organs.” <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>, <span class="smcap">General Zoology</span>, vol. vi.</p>

<p>The same naturalist specifies several large and elegant insects
in this division of the genus cicada. One with the body of a
polished black colour, marked with scarlet rings: another of a
green hue, with transparent wings, veined also with green; and
a third of a fine black varied beneath with yellow streaks, and the
wings black towards the base.</p>

<p>If no verses be
wanting here, Hesiod truly needs not boast of his skill in
nautical affairs. For what can be more absurd than to confine
all navigation within fifty days, and those beginning from the
summer-solstice; especially as the summer solstice fell on the
3d of July? I should suppose that there was a deficiency of two
verses to this effect:</p>

<p>The similarity of the lines may have caused the copyist’s
omission of the two former. I am aware that the art of navigation
was in that age imperfect: but if sea-faring men had learnt
from experience that navigation was safe fifty days <i>after</i> the
summer solstice, they could have learnt from the same teacher that
it was equally safe fifty days <i>before</i> it: namely, in the months of
May and June. <span class="smcap">Le Clerc.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_133" href="#FNanchor_133" class="label">[133]</a> <i>When many guests combine.</i>] There were two sorts of entertainments
among the ancient Grecians: the first was provided
at the expense of one man, the second was at the common
charge of all present: at the latter some of the guests occasionally
contributed more than their exact proportion. These were generally
most frequented, and are recommended by the wise men of
those times as most apt to promote friendship and good neighbourhood.
They were for the most part managed with more order
and decency, because the guests who ate of their own collation
were usually more sparing than when they were feasted at another
man’s expense; as we are informed by Eustathius. So different
was their behaviour at the public feasts from that at private entertainments,
that Minerva, in Homer, having seen the intemperance
and unseemly actions of Penelope’s courtiers, concludes
their entertainment was not provided at the common charge.</p>

is somewhat obscurely expressed, like the symbols of Pythagoras:
that things of no value might appear to involve a mysterious importance.
Hesiod seems to intimate that we should not choose
the precise time of the feast for washing the hands and paring the
nails, but sit down to table with hands ready washed. No person,
indeed, even at a private entertainment, would have thought
of cutting his nails at table, if he did not wish the parings to fly
into the dishes, which I conceive could not have been more
agreeable to the Greeks than to ourselves. <span class="smcap">Le Clerc.</span></p>

οινοχοη to be a bowl used only in libation, and which it was indecent

not the least authority.</p>

<p>“All the allegorical glosses invented by the latter Greeks to
varnish over the doting superstitions of their ancestors are utterly
destitute of verisimilitude. Even in our day traces of the old
superstitions remain in many places. There are people, for
instance, who think it a bad omen if the loaf be inverted, so that
the flat part is uppermost; if the knives be laid across, or the
salt spilt on the table. It would be just as easy to find a mystical
sense in these, as in the idle fancies of Hesiod.” <span class="smcap">Le Clerc.</span></p>

<p>Le Clerc imagines a prohibition against seizing the flesh from
the tripods before a sacrifice, which he illustrates by the offence

by sitting on immoveable things we may understand habits of
sloth. <span class="smcap">Guietus.</span></p>

<p>Proclus interprets the word to mean sepulchres, which it was
unlawful to move: but on the same grounds it may be interpreted
land-marks. One should rather understand by it any sort of
stones; Hesiod preferring that a boy should be placed on wooden
slabs that might be moved about. But the being placed on a
stone could not be more hurtful to him on the twelfth day or
month than at any other period of his childhood. This was a
mere superstition; and we may as well seek to interpret the

lunar months of thirty days. <span class="smcap">Le Clerc.</span></p>

<p>The Greek month was divided into τρια δεκημερα, three decades
of days. The first was called μηνος αρχομενου or ισταμενου; the second,
μηνος μησουντος; and the third, μηνος φθινοντος, παυομενου, or ληγοντος:
the beginning month, the middle month, the declining or ending
month. The words were put in the genitive case because some
day was placed before them. Thus the middle-first or first of the
second decade was the eleventh of the whole month; and the first
of the end, or of the last decade, was the twenty-first: the
twenty-ninth was called εικας μεγαλη, the great twentieth. The
French Republican calendar was formed on the Greek model.</p>

<h3>The Argument.</h3>

<p>The proem is a rhapsody in honour of the Muses. It opens
with a description of their solemn dances on mount Helicon,
and of the hymns which they sing during their nightly visitation
of earth. The poet then relates their appearance to himself,
and his consequent inspiration; describes their employments
in heaven; their birth and dignity; their influence on kings or
magistrates, minstrels and bards; and finishes with invoking
their assistance and proposing his subject. The <span class="smcap">Cosmogony</span>,
or origin of nature, then commences, and blends into the
<span class="smcap">Theogony</span>, or generation of gods, which is continued through
the whole poem, and concludes with the race of demi-gods, or
those born from the loves of goddesses and mortals. The following
legendary traditions are interwoven episodically with
the main subject. I. The imprisonment of his children by
<span class="smcap">Uranus</span> or <span class="smcap">Heaven</span> in a subterranean cave; and the consequent
conspiracy of <span class="smcap">Earth</span> and <span class="smcap">Cronus</span>, or <span class="smcap">Saturn</span>. II. The
concealment of the infant <span class="smcap">Jupiter</span>. III. The impiety and punishment
of Prometheus. IV. The creation of <span class="smcap">Pandora</span>, or
<span class="smcap">Woman</span>. V. The war of the <span class="smcap">Gods</span> and <span class="smcap">Titans</span>. VI. The
combat of <span class="smcap">Jupiter</span> with the giant <span class="smcap">Typhæus</span>.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0"><a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>He bound Prometheus, train’d in shifting wiles,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">With galling shackles fixing him aloft</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Midway a column. Down he sent from high</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His eagle hovering on expanded wings:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She gorged his liver: still beneath her beak</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Immortal; for it sprang with life, and grew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the night-season, and repair’d the waste</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Prometheus wilful <a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>parted a huge ox</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And set before the god: so tempting him</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The unctuous substance, entrails, and the flesh</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Close cover’d with the belly of the hide:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There the white bones he craftily disposed;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">How partial, friend! are thy divided shares!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So in rebuke spoke Jupiter: whose thoughts</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">He spoke, revolving treachery. Jove, whose thoughts</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Not unforewarn’d: and straight his soul devised</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Evil to mortals, that should surely be:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He raised the snowy portion with his hands,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And for the flame restored, he straight devised</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">A mischief to mankind. At Jove’s behest</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Entwined amidst her hair delicious wreaths</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of verdant herbage and fresh-blooming flowers;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And set a golden mitre on her brow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which Vulcan framed, and with adorning hands</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Rich-labour’d figures, marvellous to sight,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">He spake: and Cottus brave of soul replied:</div>

from the god of light, who was the patron of verse and
science. But by the Greeks it was referred to an animal, and
supposed to have been produced by the hoof of a horse. Other
nations, says Athanasius, reverenced rivers and fountains: but
above all people in the world the Ægyptians held them in the
highest honour, and esteemed them as divine. From hence the
custom passed westward to Greece, Italy, and the extremities of
Europe. One reason for holding waters so sacred arose from a

<p><a id="Footnote_146" href="#FNanchor_146" class="label">[146]</a> <i>Ye fleshly appetites.</i>] This degrading address seems to betray
a modern hand. If the proem be genuine, the shepherd’s occupation
must have degenerated in the time of Hesiod from its
ancient honourable character. But it is not likely that an agricultural
poet should speak of husbandmen in these debasing
terms. Le Clerc’s apology, that revilings such as these belong to
the manners of primeval simplicity, does not appear very satisfactory.
The poet, whoever he was, meant the address, probably,
as an exhortation to higher pursuits.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_147" href="#FNanchor_147" class="label">[147]</a> <i>A laurel-bough.</i>] Salmasius observes that they who aspired to
skill in divination, chewed the leaf of the laurel. Its poisonous
quality produced a preternatural action on the nerves, and a convulsion
and frothing at the mouth, favourable to the idea of being
possessed or inspired. As poets feigned a kind of divination,
and a knowledge of supernatural things, the laurel was equally
a symbol of poesy and prophecy: and held sacred to Phœbus,
the god of verse and divination. We find from Pausanias that
those poets who did not play on the lyre held a laurel-bough in
their hand, during their public recitations, as the badge of their
profession. Hence probably the term “rhapsodist:” επι ραβδω
αδειν, “<i>to sing to the branch</i>.” and a rhapsody seems to have
designated such a portion of verses as the bard would recite at
one time. Salmasius seems therefore mistaken in deriving the
word from ραπτειν τας ωδας, <i>stitching together songs</i>: in allusion to
the centos which the Homeric rhapsodists were accustomed to
recite from the works of Homer: although the derivation appears
countenanced by Pindar’s expression of ραπτων επεων αοιδοι, <i>singers
of tissued verses</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Bryant explains this passage in Homer by the traditionary
reverence paid to caverns: which in the first ages were deemed
oracular temples: whence persons entered into compacts under
rocks and oaks as places of security. But surely there is no
need to go back to the first ages, or to dive into traditional superstitions
for the solution of a circumstance so extremely obvious,
as that of two lovers conversing in the shade. Harmer in
his “Illustrations of the Classics,” vol. iii. of his “Observations
on Scripture,” renders απο δρυος, <i>on account of</i> an oak: instead
of <i>from an oak</i>: “when people meet each other on account of
some rock or some tree which they happen upon in travelling.”
But the alteration is quite unnecessary: the word <i>from</i> perhaps
indicates that one is resting under the tree, while the other is
passing by. The adage in Hesiod is expressed “<i>around</i> an oak:”
which implies a <i>number</i> of persons. The rock associated with
the oak marks the peculiar climate of Greece and the East.
The shade cast by a rock is described by Eastern travellers as
singularly cool.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_150" href="#FNanchor_150" class="label">[150]</a> <i>Bare the nine maids.</i>] The origin of verse itself, which is to be
sought in the necessity of some mechanical help for the memory
at an æra when letters were not invented, and every thing depended
on oral tradition, obviously accounts for the fiction of
memory being the mother of the Muses. But there is a farther
reason. The ancient temples were the depositaries of all traditionary
knowledge. We are told by Homer that the voice of the
Syrens was enchanting, but their knowledge of the past equally
so. The Syrens appear to have been merely priestesses of one
of this description of temples, which stood in Sicily, and was
erected on the sea-shore, answering also the purpose of a lighthouse.
The rites of the temple consisted partly of hymns
chanted by young and beautiful women to the sound of harps
and flutes: and it was their office to entangle by their allurements
such strangers as touched upon the coast: who were
instantly seized by the priests and sacrificed to the solar god.
The Syrens are described as the daughters of Calliope, Melpomene,
and Terpsichore; three of the Muses: they were in
fact the same with the Muses. These temples were sacred colleges:
sciences were taught there: in particular music and astronomy.
The transition was easy from the young priestesses of
these temples, to blooming goddesses who presided over history,
poetry, &amp;c. See the “Analysis of Ancient Mythology.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_152" href="#FNanchor_152" class="label">[152]</a> <i>The great assembly.</i>] The ancient Grecian princes, as Dionysius
of Halicarnassus remarks, were not absolute like the
Asiatic monarchs: their power being limited by laws and
established customs:” and this is perfectly consonant to the
higher authority of Homer. The poet himself appears a warm
friend to monarchical rule, and takes every opportunity zealously
to inculcate loyalty. “The government of many is bad: let there
be one chief, one king.” It is, however, sufficiently evident
that the poet means here to speak of executive government only:
“Let there be one chief, one king,” he says: but he adds, “to
whom Jupiter has intrusted the sceptre and the laws, <i>that by
them he may govern</i>.” Accordingly in every Grecian government
which he has occasion to enlarge upon, he plainly discovers
to us strong principles of republican rule. Not only the council
of principal men, but the assembly of the people also is familiar
to him. The name <i>agora</i> signifying a place of meeting, and the
verb formed from it to express haranguing in assemblies of the
people, were already in common use; and to be a good public
speaker was esteemed among the highest qualifications a man
could possess. In the government of Phæacia, as described in
the Odyssey, the mixture of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy
is not less clearly marked than in the British constitution.
One chief, twelve peers (all honoured, like the chief, with the
title which we translate <i>king</i>), and the assembly of the people,
shared the supreme authority. The universal and undoubted
prerogatives of kings were religious supremacy and military command.
They often also exercised judicial power. But in all
civil concerns their authority appears very limited. Every thing,
indeed, that remains concerning government in the oldest Grecian
poets and historians, tends to demonstrate that the general spirit
of it among the early Greeks was nearly the same as among our
Teutonic ancestors. The ordinary business of the community was
directed by the chiefs. Concerning extraordinary matters and
more essential interests, the multitude claimed a right to be consulted.

<p>This whole passage
is found among the fragments attributed to Homer. This
sentiment of the power of poesy and the subjects chosen by the
bard is entirely in the spirit of antiquity, when mythology and
heroism were the favourite themes. Achilles is described by
Homer as diverting the uneasiness of his mind by warlike odes
which he accompanied on the lyre, Il. ix. 189:</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_155" href="#FNanchor_155" class="label">[155]</a> <i>The servant of the Muse.</i>] Laws were always promulgated in
verse, and often publicly sung; a practice which remained in
many places long after letters were become common: morality
was taught: history was delivered in verse. Lawgivers,
philosophers, historians, all who would apply their experience or
their genius to the instruction and amusement of others, were
necessarily poets. The character of poet was therefore a character
of dignity: an opinion even of sacredness became attached
to it: a poetical genius was esteemed an effect of divine
inspiration and a mark of divine favour: and the poet, who
moreover carried with him instruction and entertainment, not to
be obtained without him, was a privileged person, enjoying by a
kind of prescription the rights of universal hospitality. <span class="smcap">Mitford.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_158" href="#FNanchor_158" class="label">[158]</a> <i>The Cyclops brethren.</i>] Thucydides acquaints us concerning
the Cyclopes, that they were the most ancient inhabitants of
Sicily, but that he could not find out their race. Strabo places
them near Ætna and Icontina, and supposes that they once ruled
over that part of the island; and it is certain that a people called
Cyclopians did possess that province. It is generally agreed by
writers upon the subject, that they were of a size superior to the
common race of mankind. Among the many tribes of the Amonians
who went abroad, were to be found people who were styled
Anakim; and were descended from the sons of Anak: so that
this history, though carried to a great excess, was probably
founded in truth. They were particularly famous for architecture;
and in all parts whither they came, they erected noble structures,
which were remarkable for their height and beauty: and were
often dedicated to the chief deity, the sun, under the name of
Elorus and P’Elorus. People were so struck with their grandeur,
that they called every thing great or stupendous Pelorian (πελωρος,
huge): and when they described the Cyclopians as a lofty towering
race, they came at last to borrow their ideas of this people from
the towers to which they alluded. They supposed them in height
to reach the clouds, and in bulk equal to the promontories on
which these edifices were founded. As these buildings were
often-times light-houses, and had in their upper story one round
casement, “like an Argolick buckler or the moon,” by which they
afforded light in the night-season, the Greeks made this a characteristic
of the people. They supposed this aperture to have
been an eye, which was fiery and glaring, and placed in the
middle of their foreheads. What confirmed the mistake was the
representation of an eye, which was often engraved over the
entrance of these temples: the chief deity of Ægypt being
elegantly represented by the symbol of an eye, which was intended
to signify the superintendency of Providence. The notion
of the Cyclopes framing the thunder and lightning for Jupiter,
arose chiefly from the Cyclopians engraving hieroglyphics of this
sort upon the temples of the deity. The poets considered them
merely in the capacity of blacksmiths, and condemned them to
the anvil. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

philosopher, translated by Philo the Jew, is recorded this
very history of Uranus and Cronus, or Saturn. De Gebelin, in his
“Monde Primitif,” resolves it, according to his system, into the
invention of reaping, which he supposes Saturn to personify.
But Saturn is often represented with a ship, as well as a sickle;
which has no reference to agriculture. The explanation may,
however, be correct, if we consider Saturn not as a mere figurative
prosopopœia of reaping, but as the real person who restored
the labours of harvest; in the same manner as his Greek name
Cronus, which some have thought to intimate a personification
of Time, points out very significantly the person who began the
new æra of time: the great father of the post-diluvian world.
The type of the ship on the ancient coins of Saturn is an apposite
emblem of the ark: and the concealment of the children of
Heaven in a cavern seems an obscure remnant of the same tradition.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_160" href="#FNanchor_160" class="label">[160]</a> <i>The foam-born goddess.</i>] The name of the Dove among the
ancient Amonians was Iön and Iönah. This term is often found
compounded, and expressed Ad-Iönah, queen dove: from which
title another deity, Adiona, was constituted. This mode of
idolatry must have been very ancient, as it is mentioned in Leviticus
and Deuteronomy, and is one species of false worship,
which Moses forbade by name. According to our method of
rendering the Hebrew term it is called Idione. This Idione or
Adione was the Dione of the Greeks: the deity who was sometimes
looked upon as the mother of Venus: at other times as
Venus herself: and styled Venus Dionæa. Venus was no other
than the ancient Iönah: and we shall find in her history numberless
circumstances relating to the Noachic dove, and to the
deluge. We are told, when the waters covered the earth, that
the dove came back to Noah, having roamed over a vast uninterrupted
ocean, and found no rest for the sole of her foot. But
upon being sent forth a second time by the patriarch, in order to
form a judgment of the state of the earth, she returned to the
ark in the evening, and “Lo! in her mouth was an olive leaf
plucked off.” From hence Noah conceived his first hopes of the
waters being assuaged, and the elements reduced to order. He
likewise began to foresee the change that was to happen in the
earth: that seed-time and harvest would be renewed, and the ground
restored to its pristine fecundity. In the hieroglyphical sculptures
and paintings where this history was represented, the dove was
depicted hovering over the face of the deep. Hence it is that
Dione, or Venus, is said to have risen from the sea. Hence it
is, also, that she is said to preside over waters, to appease the
troubled ocean, and to cause by her presence a universal calm:
that to her were owing the fruits of the earth, and the flowers of
the field were renewed by her influence. The address of Lucretius
to this goddess is founded on traditions, which manifestly allude
to the history above mentioned. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_161" href="#FNanchor_161" class="label">[161]</a> <i>Love track’d her steps.</i>] What the Greeks called Iris, was
expressed Eiras by the Ægyptians. The Greeks out of Eiras
formed Eros, a god of love, whom they annexed to Venus, and
made her son: and finding that the bow was his symbol, instead
of the iris they gave him a material bow, with the addition of a
quiver and arrows. The bows of Apollo and Diana were formed
from the same original. After the descent from the ark the first
wonderful occurrence was the bow in the clouds, and the covenant
of which it was made an emblem. At this season another
æra began. The earth was supposed to be renewed, and Time
to return to a second infancy. They therefore formed an emblem
of a child with the rainbow, to denote this renovation in the world,
and called him Eros, or Divine Love. But however like a child
he might be expressed, the more early mythologists esteemed him
the most ancient of the gods; and Lucian, with great humour,
makes Jupiter very much puzzled to account for the appearance
of this infant deity. “Why thou urchin,” says the father of the
gods, “how came you with that little childish face, when I know
you to be as old as Iapetus?” The Greek and Roman poets reduced
the character of this deity to that of a wanton, mischievous
pigmy: but he was otherwise esteemed of old. He is styled by
Plato a mighty god; and it is said that Eros was the cause of the
greatest blessings to mankind. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_164" href="#FNanchor_164" class="label">[164]</a> <i>Th’ Hesperian maids.</i>] The ancient temples in which the sun
was adored often stood within enclosures of large extent. Some
of them were beautifully planted, and ornamented with pavilions
and fountains. Places of this nature are alluded to under the
description of the gardens of the Hesperides and Alcinous.
They were also regal edifices: and termed Tor-chom and Tar-chon;
which signified a regal tower, and was of old a high
place or temple of Cham. By a corruption it was in later times
rendered Trachon. The term was still further sophisticated by
the Greeks, and expressed Drachon. The situation of these
buildings on a high eminence, and the reverence in which they
were held, made them be looked upon as places of great security.
On these accounts they were the repositories of much treasure.
When the Greeks understood that in these temples the people
worshipped a serpent-deity, they concluded that Trachon was
a serpent: hence the name Draco came to be appropriated to
that imaginary animal. Hence also arose the notion of treasures
being guarded by dragons, and of the gardens of the Hesperides
being under the protection of a serpent. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps also in these gardens was kept up the ancient Paradisiacal
tradition: as the golden apples and the dragon present
an analogy with the hieroglyphic account given by Moses of the
forbidden fruit and the serpent. This is the more probable, as
it is evident this tradition had mixed itself in the dispersed
legends of pagan mythology from the remarkable coincidence of
the “serpent-woman,” considered by the Mexicans as the mother
of the human race, and ranked next to “the god of the celestial
paradise.” The Mexican temples, also, where “the great
spirit,” or sun personified, was worshipped, are described by
Humboldt in his “American Researches,” as raised in the
midst of a square and walled enclosure, which contained gardens
and fountains. This mixed worship of the Paradisiacal serpent
may account for a serpent, twisted into the form of a fillet,
being made an emblem of the sun’s disk: and for snaky hair
being typical of divine wisdom: while the tresses were, at the
same time, so disposed as to figure the sun’s rays, and the human
visage represented his orb.</p>

<p>The Hesperian virgins seem the same with the Muses and
Syrens, the priestesses of the temple: and their singing sweetly
on their watch, as described afterwards by Hesiod, alludes to
the hymns which they chanted at the altar. They are made the
daughters of Night, because the gardens were in Afric: which,
equally with Italy and Spain, was denominated <i>Hesperia</i> by the
Greeks: and the region of the west was considered as synonymous
with Night.</p>

<p>The island of
Seriphus is represented as having once abounded with serpents;
and it is styled by Virgil in his Ciris <i>serpentifera</i>: it had this
epithet, not on account of any real serpents, but according to
the Greeks, from Medusa’s head, which was brought thither by
Perseus. By this is meant the serpent-deity, whose worship was
here introduced by a people called Peresians. It was usual with
the Ægyptians to describe upon the architrave of their temples
some emblem of the deity who there presided: among others the
serpent was esteemed a most salutary emblem, and they made
use of it to signify superior skill and knowledge. A beautiful
female countenance surrounded with an assemblage of serpents
was made to denote divine wisdom. Many ancient temples were
ornamented with this curious hieroglyphic. These devices upon
temples were often esteemed as talismans, and supposed to have
a hidden influence by which the building was preserved. In the
temple of Minerva, at Tigea, was some sculpture of Medusa,
which the goddess was said to have given to preserve the city
from ever being taken in war. It was probably from this opinion
that the Athenians had the head of Medusa represented on the
walls of their Acropolis; and it was the insigne of many cities,
as we find from ancient coins. Perseus was one of the most
ancient heroes in the mythology of Greece: the merit of whose
supposed achievements the Helladians took to themselves, and
gave out that he was a native of Argos. Herodotus more truly
represents him as an Assyrian; by which is meant a Babylonian.
Yet he resided in Ægypt, and is said to have reigned at Memphis.
To say the truth, he was <i>worshipped</i> at that place: for Perseus
was a title of the deity, and was no other than the Sun, the
chief god of the gentile world. His true name was Perez;
rendered Peresis, Perses, and Perseus: and in the account given
of this personage we have the history of the Peresians in their
several peregrinations; who were no other than the Heliadæ and
Osirians. It is a mixed history in which their forefathers are
alluded to: particularly their great progenitor, the father of
mankind. He was supposed to have had a renewal of life:
they therefore described Perseus as enclosed in an ark and exposed
in a state of childhood on the waters, after having been
conceived in a shower of gold. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_173" href="#FNanchor_173" class="label">[173]</a> <i>The great Chrysaor.</i>] Chus by the Ægyptians and Canaanites
was styled Or-chus, and Chus-or: the latter of which was expressed
by the Greeks by a word more familiar to their ear
Chrusor; as if it had a reference to gold. This name was sometimes
changed into Chrusaor: and occurs in many places where
the Cuthites were known to have settled. They were a long time
in Ægypt: and we read of a Chrusaor in those parts, who is said
to have sprung from the blood of Medusa. We meet with the
same Chrusaor in the regions of Asia Minor, especially among the
Carians: in those parts he was particularly worshipped, and
said to have been the first deified mortal. The Grecians borrowed
this term, and applied it to Apollo: and from this epithet, Chrusaor,
he was denominated the god of the golden sword. This
weapon was at no time ascribed to him, nor is he ever represented
with one either on a gem or marble. He is described by Homer
in the hymn to Apollo, as wishing for a harp and a bow. There
is never any mention made of a sword, nor was the term Chrusaor
of Grecian etymology. Since, then, we may be assured
that Chus was the person alluded to, we need not wonder that
so many cities, where Apollo was particularly worshipped, should
be called Chruse, and Chrusopolis. Nor is this observable in
cities only, but in rivers. It was usual in the first ages to consecrate
rivers to deities, and to call them after their names.
Hence many were denominated from Chrusorus: which by the
Greeks was changed to χρυσορροας, <i>flowing with gold</i>: and from
this mistake, the Nile was called <i>Chrusorrhoas</i>, which had no
pretensions to gold. In all the places where the sons of Chus
spread themselves, the Greeks introduced some legend about gold.
Hence we read of a <i>golden</i> fleece at Colchis: <i>golden</i> apples at
the Hesperides: at Tartessus a <i>golden</i> cup: and at Cuma in
Campania a <i>golden</i> branch. But although this repeated mistake
arose in great measure from the term Chusus being easily convertible
into Chrusus, there was another obvious reason for the
change. Chus was by many of the Eastern nations expressed
Cuth; and his posterity, the Cuthim. This term, in the ancient
Chaldaic and other Amonian languages, signified <i>gold</i>: and
hence many cities and countries where the Cuthites settled were
described as golden. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_174" href="#FNanchor_174" class="label">[174]</a> <i>And Pegasus the steed.</i>] Pegasus received its name from a
well-known emblem, the horse of Poseidon: by which we are
to understand an ark or ship. “By horses,” says Artemidorus,
“the poets mean ships:” and hence it is that Poseidon is called
Hippius; for there is a strict analogy between the poetical or
winged horse on land, and a real ship in the sea. Hence it came
that Pegasus was esteemed the horse of Poseidon (Neptune), and
often named <i>scuphius</i>; a name which relates to a ship, and shows
the purport of the emblem. The ark, we know, was preserved
by divine providence from the sea, which would have overwhelmed
it: and as it was often represented under this symbol
of a horse, it gave rise to the fable of the two chief deities,
Jupiter and Neptune, disputing about horses. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p>To this we may add the still more remarkable fable of the dispute
between Neptune and Pallas: when the former produces a
horse, and the latter an olive-tree. “These notions,” observes the
author of the Analysis, “arose from emblematical descriptions of
the deluge, which the Grecians had received by tradition: but
what was general they limited, and appropriated to particular
places.”</p>

where a prince was supposed to have reigned, named Geryon.
The harbour at Gades was a very fine one, and had several tor,
or towers, to direct shipping: and as it was usual to imagine the
deity to whom the temple was erected to have been the builder,
this temple was said to have been built by Hercules. All this
the Grecians took to themselves. They attributed the whole to
Hercules of Thebes: and as he was supposed to conquer wherever
he came, they made him subdue Geryon: and changing the
tor or towers into so many head of cattle, they describe him as
leading them off in triumph. Tor-keren signified a regal tower;
and this being interpreted τρικαρηνος, this personage was in consequence
described with three heads. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

It had a relation to the deluge. In hieroglyphical descriptions,
the dove was represented as hovering over the mundane

term properly signified the temple, or place, of the Sun. The
great luminary was styled by the Amonians both Or and Abor;
that is, light, and the parent of light: and Cerberus is properly
Kir-abor, the place of that deity. The same temple had different
names from the diversity of the god’s titles, who was there
worshipped. It was called Tor-caph-el; which was changed to
τρικεφαλος: and Cerberus was from hence supposed to have had
three heads. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p>The poets increased the number of heads, as they seem to
have thought a multitude of heads or arras sublimely terrific.

Phaselis, situated upon the mountain Chimæra; which mountain
was sacred to the god of fire. Phaselis is a compound of Phi,
which in the Amonian language is a mouth or opening, and of
Az-el: another name for Orus, the god of light. Phaselis signifies
a chasm of fire. The reason why this name was imposed
may be seen in the history of the place. All the country around
abounded in fiery eruptions. Chimæra is a compound of Chamur,
the name of the deity, whose altar stood towards the top of
the mountain. But the most satisfactory idea of it may be obtained

Aleppo continue the same traditional custom of tinging the inside
of the eye-lid. Dr. Russel describes the operation as effected
“by means of a short smooth probe of ivory, wood, or silver;
charged with a powder named the black Kohol. This substance
is a kind of lead-ore brought from Persia: and is prepared by
roasting it in a quince, an apple, or a truffle; then, adding a few
drops of oil of almonds, it is ground to a subtile powder on a
marble. The probe being first dipped in water, a little of the
powder is sprinkled on it. The middle part is then applied horizontally
to the eye, and the eye-lids being shut upon it, the
probe is drawn through between them, leaving the inside tinged,
and a black rim all round the edge. The Kohol is used likewise
by the men: but not so generally by way of ornament merely:
the practice being deemed rather effeminate. It is supposed to
strengthen the sight and prevent various disorders of the eye.”

of editors suppose Hesiod to omit the east-wind entirely:
and consider αργεστεω as an epithet, signifying <i>swift</i> or <i>serene</i>:
as the term is so used by Homer. Grævius quotes a subsequent
line of the Theogony as authority for αργεστης being so used by
Hesiod also: but there is evidence for αργεστης being the name of
a wind; though Aulus Gellius and Pliny suppose it to be a west-wind,
called by the Latins Caurus. Aristotle also, as is observed
by the Monthly Reviewer, describes the αργεστης as a
westerly wind, which blows from that part of the heaven in
which the sun sets at the summer solstice: and adds that by
some it is called Olympias, by others Iapyx. We see however
from this very passage of Aristotle, that the names of winds
were capricious and arbitrary: and in fact almost every district
in Greece called the winds by names different from those which
the neighbouring district used. The same critic observes that in
a note to the word σκειροιν (Caurus), in Alberti’s edition of Hesychius,
an opinion is intimated that αργεστης is properly an
easterly wind, απηλιωτης ανεμος: nor can there be the least doubt
of the matter, in so far as regards Hesiod. The London Reviewer,
indeed, remarks that “the omission of the wind would
be no proof of Hesiod’s ignorance of its existence”: a similar
omission occurs in the Psalms. “Promotion cometh neither
from the east, nor the west, nor yet from the south.” But it is
forgotten that Hesiod is describing the genealogy of the winds:
and it is very inconceivable that one of the four cardinal winds

<p>Εκατη was a
title of Diana, as εκατος of Apollo: from εκας <i>far off</i>: alluding
to the distance to which the sun and moon dart their rays. This
goddess is represented in ancient sculptures as three females
joined in one, with various attributes in their hands: this triple
figure was combined of the three characters sustained by the
moon: who was Selene or Luna in heaven, Diana on earth,
and Proserpine in the subterranean regions. Luna is said by
Cicero to be the same as Lucina, the goddess of child-bearing:
a title given also to Diana and Juno. Hecate has also assigned
to her by Hesiod the office of foster-mother of children. This
may be explained partly by the reckoning of pregnant women
being guided by the number of lunar periods; and partly by the
emblematic character of the moon, as an object of worship.</p>

<p>“The moon was a type of the ark: the sacred ship of Osiris
being represented in the form of a crescent, of which the moon
was made an emblem. Selene was the reputed mother of the
world, as Plutarch confesses: which character cannot be made
in any degree to correspond with the planet. Selene was the
same as Isis: the same also as Rhea, Vesta, Cubele, and Damater,
or Ceres.” <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p>These female deities not only melt into each other, but at last
resolve themselves into the one Zeus: so that the lunar idolatry
is absorbed ultimately in the solar. “The patriarch had the
names of Meen or Menes; which signify a moon, and was
worshipped all over the east as Deus Lunus. Strabo mentions
several temples of this lunar god in different places: all these
were dedicated to the same Arkite deity, called Lunus, Luna,
and Selene. The same deity was both masculine and feminine:
what was Deus Lunus in one country was Dea Luna in another.
Meen was also one of the most ancient titles of the Ægyptian
Osiris; the same as Apollo.” <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p>The sacred bull Apis is figured in the ancient coins and sculptures,
with a crescent moon upon his head instead of horns: by
which the great restorer of husbandry, Noah, was connected
with the ark in which he had been miraculously preserved; and
of which the lunar crescent was an emblem.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_191" href="#FNanchor_191" class="label">[191]</a> <i>Her wide allotment stands.</i>] The other gods were either celestial,
terrestrial, marine, or subterranean: but the divinity of
Hecate pervaded heaven, earth, and the abyss, from her being
intermixed with Luna, Dian, and Proserpine: and the sea,
from the moon influencing the tides. She was invoked at sacrifices,
probably, as presiding over divination from the entrails
of beasts: because she was the patroness of magical rites and
incantations: from such ceremonies being performed in the secrecy
of night by the light of the moon. The Greeks, on every
new moon, were accustomed to spread a feast in the cross-ways,
which was carried away by the poor: this was called “Hecate’s
supper;” and was said to have been eaten by Hecaté. See

are traditional records of the glory attached by the Greeks to the
conquerors in their games: a glory which extended to their
parents and connexions, and even to the city in which they were
born. Cicero describes the return from an Olympic victory as
equivalent to a Roman triumph. The victor in fact rode in a
triumphal chariot, and entered through a breach in the walls
into the city: which Plutarch explains to signify that walls are
useless with such defenders. The same writer relates, that a
Spartan meeting Diagoras, who had been crowned in the Olympic
games, and had seen his sons and grand-children crowned after
him, exclaimed, “Die Diagoras! for thou canst not be a god.”

<p><a id="Footnote_194" href="#FNanchor_194" class="label">[194]</a> <i>Golden-sandal’d Juno.</i>] Juno was the same as Iöna: and she
was particularly styled Juno of Argus. Argus was one of the
terms by which the ark was distinguished. The Grecians called
her Hera; which was not originally a proper name, but a title:
the same as Ada of the Babylonians; and expressed “the
Lady” or “Queen.” She was the same as Luna or Selene, from
her connexion with the ark; and at Samos she was described
as standing in a lunette, with the lunar emblem on her head.
She was sometimes worshipped under the symbol of an egg: so
that her history had the same reference as that of Venus. She
presided equally over the seas, which she was supposed to calm
or trouble. Isis, Io, and Ino were the same as Juno, and Venus
also was the same deity under a different title. Hence in Laconia
there was an ancient statue of the goddess styled Venus
Junonia. Juno was also called Cupris, and under that title was
worshipped by the Hetrurians. As Juno was the same with Iöna
we need not wonder at the Iris being her concomitant. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_195" href="#FNanchor_195" class="label">[195]</a> <i>Ceres, and Vesta.</i>] Ceres was the deity of fire; hence at
Cnidus she was called Cura: a title of the Sun. The Roman
name Ceres, expressed by Hesychius Gerys, was by the Dorians
more properly rendered Garis. It was originally the name of a
city called Charis: for many of the deities were erroneously
called by the names of the places where they were worshipped.
Charis is Char-is, the city of fire: the place where Orus and
Hephaistus were worshipped. It may after this seem extraordinary
that she should ever be esteemed the goddess of corn.
This notion arose from the Greeks not understanding their own
theology. The towers of Ceres were P’urtain or Prutaneia: so
called from the fires which were perpetually there preserved.
The Grecians interpreted this <i>purou tameion</i>: and rendered what
was a temple, a granary of corn. In consequence of this,
though they did not abolish the ancient usage of the place, they
made it a repository of grain; from whence they gave largesses
to the people. In early times the corn there deposited seems to
have been for the priests or divines: but this was only a secondary
use to which these places were adapted. They were properly
sacred towers, where a perpetual fire was preserved. It was
sacred to Hestia, the Vesta of the Romans, which was only
another title for Damater or Ceres: and the sacred hearth had
the same name. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

Serapis: others that he is Dionusus: others still that he is Pluto:
many take him for Zeus or Jupiter, and not a few for Pan.”
This was an unnecessary embarrassment, for they were all titles
of the same god. Pluto, among the best mythologists, was
esteemed the same as Jupiter; and indeed the same as Proserpine,
Ceres, Hermes, Apollo, and every other deity. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_197" href="#FNanchor_197" class="label">[197]</a> <i>Earth-shaker Neptune.</i>] The patriarch was commemorated
by the name of Poseidon. Under the character of Neptune
Genesius he had a temple in Argolis: hard by was a spot of
ground called <i>the place of descent</i>; similar to the place on
mount Ararat, mentioned by Josephus; and undoubtedly named
from the same ancient history. The tradition of the people of
Argolis was, that it was so called because in this spot Danaus
made his first descent from the ship in which he came over.
In Arcadia was a temple of “Neptune <i>looking-out</i>.” Poseidon god
of the sea was also reputed the chief god, the deity of fire.
This we may infer from his priest; who was styled P’urcon.
P’urcon is the lord of fire or light; and from the name of the
priest we may know the department of the god. He was no
other than the supreme deity, the Sun: from whom all may
be supposed to descend. Hence Neptune in the Orphic verses is,
like Zeus or Jupiter, styled the father of gods and men. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

Bacchus are identified with the Sun: which is described as the
source of all things. Hammon, the African Jupiter, is mentioned
by Lucan; who specifies his having horns. These were
the lunar crescent of Apis or Osiris, the Arkite god. The patriarch,
his son Ham, and his grandson Chus, are reciprocally
mixed with each other; in the same manner as the ark and the
dove: the moon, the sun, and the typical serpent, are often
mixed and confounded in this hieroglyphical mythology.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_199" href="#FNanchor_199" class="label">[199]</a> <i>To his own son he should bow down his strength.</i>] Although
the Romans made a distinction between Janus and Saturn they
were two titles of one and the same person. The former had the
remarkable characteristic of being the author of time, and the
god of the new year: the latter also was looked upon as the
author of time, and held in his hand a serpent, whose tail was
in his mouth and formed a circle: by which emblem was denoted
the renovation of the year. On their coins they were
equally represented with keys in their hand and a ship near them.
Janus was described with two faces: the one that of an aged
man; the other that of a youthful personage. Saturn as of an
uncommon age with hair white like snow: but they had a notion
that he would return to infancy. He is also said to have destroyed
all things: which however were restored with vast increase.
<span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p>The faces of Janus, supposed to look to the time past and
that which is to come, evidently regard the æra before the flood
and that after it: and the aged and youthful visage represent the
old world and the new. The keys may allude to the shutting up
the productions of the earth, and again opening them. The ship
is the ark. The story of Saturn and the infant Jupiter involves
similar allusions. The old god devouring his children significantly
points to the destruction of the human race. Saturn and
Jupiter seem only separate personifications of the double visage
of Janus: and the infant Jupiter personifies the second infancy
of Saturn. The new order of things which took place on the
renovation of nature is typified in the dethronement of the aged
monarch by his youthful son.</p>

<p>The stone,

and upon festivals was otherwise honoured. The purport of the
above history I take to have been this. It was for a long time
the custom to offer children at the altar of Saturn: but in process
of time they removed it, and in its form erected a stone
pillar, before which they made their vows, and offered sacrifices
of another nature. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

the gods, constructed the first ship, and transmitted to posterity
many useful inventions. He was supposed to have lived at the
time of the deluge, and to have been guardian of Ægypt at that
season. He was the same as Osiris, the great husbandman, the
planter of the vine, and inventor of the plough. Prometheus is
said to have been exposed on mount Caucasus, near Colchis,
with an eagle placed over him, preying on his heart. These
strange histories are undoubtedly taken from the symbols and
devices which were carved upon the front of the ancient Amonian
temples, and especially those of Ægypt. The eagle and
vulture were the insignia of that country. We are told by Orus
Apollo that a heart over burning coals was an emblem of Ægypt.
The history of Tityus, Prometheus, and many other poetical
personages was certainly taken from hieroglyphics misunderstood
and badly explained. Prometheus was worshipped by the Colchians
as a deity, and had a temple and high place upon mount

food: and Hesiod’s tale of the division of the ox may be only a
disfigured representation of the first sacrifice after the flood.
The affinity of Iäpetus, the father of Prometheus, with Japhet,
is very remarkable. This confusion of personages has been
already noticed as common in the ancient mythology.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_204" href="#FNanchor_204" class="label">[204]</a> <i>Pernicious is the race.</i>] Lord Kaimes, in his sketches of the
History of Man, i. 6. observes that in the more polished age
of Greece women were treated with but little consideration by
their husbands: and female influence was confined to the artful
accomplishments of courtezans. But it was very different at an
earlier æra of society. “Women in the Homeric age,” remarks
Mr. Mitford, “enjoyed more freedom, and communicated more in
business and amusement among men, than in after-ages has been
usual in those eastern countries; far more than at Athens, in the
flourishing times of the commonwealth. Equally, indeed,
Homer’s elegant eulogies and Hesiod’s severe sarcasm prove
women to have been in their days important members of society.”</p>

<p>Milton has imitated this description of the infelicities supposed
to be produced by woman-kind, in a prophetic complaint,
which comes with beautiful propriety from the lips of Adam:
and which his own domestic unhappiness enabled him to express
with feeling.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Of glorious Titans.</i>]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The giants, whom
Abydenus makes the builders of Babel, are by other writers represented
as the Titans. They are said to have received their
name from their mother Titæa: by which we are to understand
that they were denominated from their religion and place of
worship. The ancient altars consisted of a conical hill of earth,
in the shape of a woman’s breast. Titæa was one of these. It
is a term compounded of Tit-aia, and signifies literally a breast
of earth. These altars were also called Tit-an, and Tit-anis,
from the great fountain of night, styled An and Anis: hence
many places were called Titanis and Titana where the worship
of the sun prevailed. By these giants and Titans are always
meant the sons of Ham and Chus. That the sons of Chus were
the chief agents both in erecting the tower of Babel, and in
maintaining principles of rebellion, is plain: for it is said of
Nimrod, the son of Chus, that “the beginning of his kingdom
was Babel.” The sons of Chus would not submit to the divine
dispensation in the original disposition of the several families:
and Nimrod, who first took upon him regal state, drove Ashur
from his demesnes, and forced him to take shelter in the higher
parts of Mesopotamia. This was their first act of rebellion and
apostacy. Their second was to erect a lofty tower, as a landmark
to repair to, as a token to direct them, and prevent their
being scattered abroad. It was an idolatrous temple, erected in
honour of the sun, and called the tower of Bel: as the city,
from its consecration to the sun, was named Bel-on: the city of
the solar god. Their intention was to have founded a great, if
not an universal, empire: but their purpose was defeated by
the confounding of their labial utterance. By this judgment they
were dispersed; the tower was deserted; and the city left
unfinished. These circumstances seem, in great measure, to be
recorded by the gentile writers. They add, that a war soon after
commenced between the Titans and the family of Zeuth.
This was no other than the war mentioned by Moses; which was
carried on by four kings of the family of Shem against the sons
of Ham and Chus. The dispersion from Babylonia had weakened
the Cuthites. The house of Shem took advantage of their
dissipation, and recovered the land of Shinar, which had been
unduly usurped by their enemies. After this success they proceeded
farther: and attacked the Titans in all their quarters.
After a contest of some time they made them tributaries: but
upon their rising in rebellion, after a space of thirteen years, the
confederates made a fresh inroad into their countries. “Twelve
years they served Chedorlaomer: and in the thirteenth they rebelled:
and in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the
kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashtaroth
Karnaim;” who were no other than the Titans. They were
accordingly rendered by the Seventy, “the giant brood of Ashtaroth:”
and the valley of the Rephaim, in Samuel, is translated
“the valley of the Titans.” From the sacred historians
we may then infer that there were two periods of this war. The
first, when the king of Elam and his associates laid the Rephaim
under contribution: the other, when, upon their rebellion, they
reduced them a second time to obedience. The first part is
mentioned by several ancient writers, and is said to have lasted
ten years. Hesiod takes notice of both, but makes the first
rather of longer duration:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Ten years and more they sternly strove in arms.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the second engagement the poet informs us that the Titans
were quite discomfited and ruined: and according to the mythology
of the Greeks, they were condemned to reside in Tartarus,
at the extremity of the known world. A large body of
Titanians, after their dispersion, settled in Mauritania: which is
the region called Tartarus. The mythologists adjudged the
Titans to the realms of night merely from not attending to the
purport of the term ζοφος. This word described the West, and
it signified also darkness. From this secondary acceptation the
Titans of the West were consigned to the realms of night: being
situated, with respect to Greece towards the regions of the setting
sun. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p>There is, however, nothing in Milton which equals in sublimity
the sudden expansion of power in the soul of the deity: ειθαρ
μεν μενεος πληντο φρενες. The plan of the battle of angels is evidently
built on that of the battle of giants: the Messiah, like
Hesiod’s Jove, coming forth to decide the contest; and sending
before him thunderbolts and plagues. Milton’s magnificent
imagery of the chariot is borrowed from the vision of the prophet
Ezekiel.</p>

<p>The ancients had
a notion that the earth was a widely extended plain, which terminated
abruptly in a vast clift of immeasurable descent. At
the bottom was a chaotic pool, which so far sunk beneath the
confines of the world, that, to express the depth and distance,
they imagined an anvil of iron, tossed from the top, could not
reach it in ten days. This mighty pool was the great Atlantic
ocean: and these extreme parts of the earth were Mauritania
and Iberia: for in each of these countries the Titans resided.

to the deity under the name of Persephone or Proserpine,
who was supposed her daughter; but they were in reality the
same personage. Persephone was styled Cora; which the Greeks
misinterpreted the virgin or damsel. This was the same as
Cura, a feminine title of the Sun; by which Ceres also was
called at Cnidos. However mild and gentle Proserpine may
have been represented in her virgin state by the poets, yet her
tribunal seems in many places to have been very formidable. In
consequence of this we find her, with Minos and Rhadamanthus,
condemned to the shades below as an infernal inquisitor. Nonnus
says, “Proserpine armed the Furies:” the notion of which
Furies arose from the cruelties practised in the Prutaneia, or
fire-temples. They were originally only priests of fire; but were
at last ranked among the hellish tormentors. Herodotus speaks
of a Prutaneion in Achaia Pthiotic, of which he gives a fearful
account. No person, he says, ever entered the precincts, that
returned: whatever person strayed that way was immediately
seized upon by the priests and sacrificed. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_227" href="#FNanchor_227" class="label">[227]</a> <i>Her youngest-born Typhœus.</i>] Taph, which at times was
rendered Tuph, Toph, and Taphos, was a name current among
the Amonians, by which they called their high places. Lower
Ægypt being a flat, and annually overflowed, the natives were
forced to raise the soil on which they built their principal edifices,
in order to secure them from the inundation: and many of their
sacred towers were erected on conical mounds of earth. There
were often hills of the same form constructed for religious purposes,
upon which there was no building. These were high
altars; on which they used sometimes to offer human sacrifices.
Tophet, where the Israelites made their children pass through
fire to Moloch, was a mount of this form. Those cities in
Ægypt which had a high place of this sort, and rites in consequence
of it, were styled Typhonian. Many writers say that
these rites were performed to Typhon at the tomb of Osiris.
Hence he was in later times supposed to have been a person;
one of immense size; and he was also esteemed a god. But this
arose from the common mistake by which places were substituted
for the deities there worshipped. Typhon was the Tuph-on, or
altar; and the offerings were made to the Sun, styled On; the
same as Osiris and Busiris. What they called his tombs were
mounds of earth raised very high: some of these had also lofty
towers adorned with pinnacles and battlements. They had also
carved on them various symbols; and particularly serpentine
hieroglyphics; in memorial of the god to whom they were sacred.
In their upper story was a perpetual fire, that was plainly seen in
the night. The gigantic stature of Typhon was borrowed from this
object: and his character was formed from the hieroglyphical
representations in the temples styled Typhonian. This may be
inferred from the allegorical description of Typhœus given by
Hesiod. Typhon and Typhœus were the same personage; and
the poet represents him of a mixed form; being partly a man,
and partly a monstrous dragon, whose head consisted of an assemblage
of smaller serpents: and as there was a perpetual fire
kept up in the upper story, he describes it as shining through the
apertures of the building. The tower of Babel was undoubtedly
a Tuph-on, or altar of the Sun; though generally represented as
a temple. Hesiod certainly alludes to some ancient history concerning
the demolition of Babel, when he describes Typhon or
Typhœus as overthrown by Jove. He represents him as the
youngest son of Earth; as a deity of great strength and immense
stature; and adds what is very remarkable, that had it not been
for the interposition of the chief god, this dæmon would have
obtained a universal empire. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p>Equally remarkable is the diversity of voices, described as
issuing from the different heads of the giant. In the Mexican
mythology a giant builds an artificial hill, in the form of a pyramid,
as a memorial of the mountain, in whose caverns he,
with six others, had taken shelter from a deluge. This monument
was to reach the clouds; but the gods destroyed it with
fire. See Humboldt’s American Researches.</p>

that is, the Sun. Later mythologists degraded him to a blacksmith;

<p><a id="Footnote_240" href="#FNanchor_240" class="label">[240]</a> <i>Sea-potent Triton.</i>] The Hetrurians erected on their shores
towers and beacons for the sake of their navigation, which they
called Tor-ain: whence they had a still farther denomination of
Tor-aini (Tyrrheni). Another name for buildings of this nature
was Tirit or Turit: which signified a tower or turret. The name
of Triton is a contraction of Tirit-on: and signifies the tower of
the Sun: but a deity was framed from it, who was supposed to
have had the appearance of a man upwards, but downwards to
have been like a fish. The Hetrurians are thought to have been
the inventors of trumpets; and in their towers on the sea-coast
there were people appointed to be continually on the watch, both
by day and by night, and to give a proper signal if any thing
happened extraordinary. This was done by a blast from the
trumpet. In early times, however, these brazen instruments
were but little known; and people were obliged to use what were
near at hand; the conchs of the sea: by sounding these they
gave signals from the tops of the towers when any ship appeared:
and this is the implement with which Triton is more
commonly furnished. So Amphi-tirit is merely an oracular tower,
which by the poets has been changed into Amphitrite, and made
the wife of Neptune. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

</div>

<p>I am persuaded
that no such person as Cadmus ever existed. If we consider
the whole history of this celebrated hero, we shall find that
it was impossible for any one person to have effected what he is
supposed to have performed. They were not the achievements of
one person nor of one age: the travels of Cadmus, like the expeditions
of Perseus, Sesostris, and Osiris, relate to colonies,
which at different times went abroad and were distinguished by
this title. As colonies of the same denomination went to parts of
the world widely distant, their ideal chieftain, whether Cadmus,
or Bacchus, or Hercules, was supposed to have traversed the
same ground.</p>

<p>Harmonia, the wife of Cadmus, who has been esteemed a
mere woman, seems to have been an emblem of nature, and the
fostering nurse of all things. In some of the Orphic verses she
is represented not only as a deity, but as the light of the world.
She was supposed to have been a personage from whom all
knowledge was derived. On this account the books of science
were styled the books of Harmonia: as well as the books of
Hermes. These were four in number; of which Nonnus gives
a curious account, and says that they contained matter of wonderful
antiquity. The first of them is said to be coeval with the
world. Hence we find that Hermon or Harmonia was a deity to
whom the first writing is ascribed. The same is said of Hermes.
The invention is also attributed to Thoth. Cadmus is said not
only to have brought letters into Greece, but to have been the
inventor of them. Whence we may fairly conclude, that under
the characters of Hermon, Hermes, Thoth, and Cadmus, one
person is alluded to.</p>

<p>The story of Cadmus, and of the serpent with which he engaged
upon his arrival in Bœotia, relates to the Ophite worship
which was there instituted by the Cadmians. So Jason in Colchis,
Apollo in Phocis, Hercules at Lerna, engaged with serpents: all
of which are histories of the same purport, but mistaken by the
latter Grecians. It is said of Cadmus that, at the close of his
life, he was, together with his wife Harmonia, changed into a
serpent of stone. This wonderful metamorphosis is supposed to
have happened at Encheliæ, a town of Illyria. The true history
is this. These two personages were here enshrined in a temple,
and worshipped under the symbol of a serpent. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_243" href="#FNanchor_243" class="label">[243]</a> <i>The glorious Hermes, herald of the gods.</i>] The Ægyptians
acknowledged two personages under the title of Hermes and
Thoth. The first was the same as Osiris; the most ancient of
all the gods, and the head of all. The other was called the
second Hermes; and likewise, for excellence, styled Trismegistus.
This person is said to have been a great adept in mysterious
knowledge, and an interpreter of the will of the gods.
He was a great prophet; and on that account was looked upon
as a divinity. To him they ascribed the reformation of the
Ægyptian year: and there were many books, either written by
him, or concerning him, which were preserved by the Ægyptians
in the most sacred recesses of their temples. As he had been
the cause of great riches to their nation, they styled him the
dispenser of wealth, and esteemed him the god of gain. We
are told that the true name of this Hermes was Siphoas. What
is Siphoas but Aosiph misplaced? and is not Aosiph the
Ægyptian name of the patriarch Joseph, as he was called by the
Hebrews? <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_245" href="#FNanchor_245" class="label">[245]</a> <i>Bacchus of golden hair.</i>] The history of Dionusus is closely
connected with that of Bacchus, though they were two distinct
persons. Dionusos is interpreted by the Latins Bacchus; but
very improperly. Bacchus was Chus, the grandson of Noah;
as Ammon was Ham. Dionusus was Noah; expressed Noos,
Nus, Nusus; the planter of the vine, and the inventor of fermented
liquors: whence he was also denominated Zeuth; which
signifies ferment; rendered Zeus by the Greeks. Dionusus was
the same as Osiris. According to the Grecian mythology, he is
represented as having been twice born; and is said to have had
two fathers and two mothers. He was also exposed in an ark,
and wonderfully preserved. The purport of which histories is
plain. We must, however, for the most part, consider the account
given of Dionusus as the history of the Dionusians. This
is two-fold: part relates to their rites and religion, in which
the great events of the infant world and preservation of mankind
in general were recorded: in the other part, which contains the
expeditions and conquests of this personage, are enumerated
the various colonies of the people who were denominated from
him. They were the same as the Osirians and Herculeans.
There were many places which claimed his birth: and as many
where was shown the spot of his interment. The Grecians,
wherever they met with a grot or cavern sacred to him, took it
for granted that he was born there: and wherever he had a
taphos, or high altar, supposed that he was there buried. The
same is also observable in the history of all the gods.</p>

<p>There are few characters which at first sight appear more distinct
than those of Apollo and Bacchus. Yet the department
which is generally appropriated to Apollo as the Sun, I mean the
conduct of the year, is by Virgil given to Bacchus, Georg. i. 5:</p>

chief deity of the gentiles: who has been multiplied into almost
as many personages as there were countries where he was
worshipped. What has been attributed to this god singly was
the work of Herculeans, a people who went under this title,
among the many which they assumed, and who were the same
as the Osirians, Peresians, and Cuthites. Wherever there were
Herculeans, a Hercules has been supposed. Hence his character
has been variously represented. One while he appears little
better than a sturdy vagrant: at other times he is mentioned as
a great benefactor; also as the patron of science; the god of
eloquence, with the Muses in his train. He was the same as
Hermes, Osiris, and Dionusus; and his rites were introduced
into various parts by the Cuthites. In the detail of his peregrinations
is contained in great measure a history of that people,
and of their settlements. Each of these the Greeks have described

This truth the best writers among the Grecians confess; though
the merit of the performance they would fain take to themselves.
Yet after all their prejudices, they continually betray the truth,
and show that the history was derived to them from Ægypt.
Plutarch informs us, that the constellation, which the Greeks
called the Argo, was a representation of the sacred ship of
Osiris: and that it was out of reverence placed in the heavens.
The ship of Osiris was esteemed the first ship constructed; and
was no other than the ark. Jason was certainly a title of the
Arkite god; the same as Areas, Argus, Inachus, and Prometheus:
and the temples supposed to have been built by him in
regions so remote were temples erected to his honour. It is

worship was introduced, were many of them Anakim; and are
accordingly represented as of great strength and stature. Such
persons among the people of the East were styled <i>nephele</i>,
which the Greeks, in after-times, supposed to relate to Nephele,
a cloud: and in consequence described the Centaurs as born of a
cloud. Chiron was a temple: probably at Nephele in Thessalia;
the most ancient seat of the Nephelim. His name is a compound
of Chir-on: the tower or temple of the Sun. In places of this
sort, people used to study the heavenly motions; and they were
made use of for seminaries, where young persons were instructed.
Hence Achilles was said to have been taught by Chiron; who is
reported to have had many disciples. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_251" href="#FNanchor_251" class="label">[251]</a> <i>Circe.</i>] From the knowledge of the Cuthites in herbs we may
justly infer a great excellence in physic. Ægypt the nurse of arts,
was much celebrated for botany. To the Titanians, or race of
Chus, was attributed the invention of chemistry: hence it is
said by Syncellus, that chemistry was the discovery of the
Giants. Circe and Calypso are, like Medea, represented as
very experienced in pharmacy and simples. Under these characters
we have the history of Cuthite priestesses, who presided
in particular temples near the sea-coast, and whose charms and
incantations were thought to have a wonderful influence. The
nymphs who attended them were a lower order in these sacred
colleges; and they were instructed by their superiors in their arts
and mysteries. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Amphitryon gallant shone: and in his host</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Within his breast the sire of gods and men:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Sprung from his loins, of plague-repelling fame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deep-framing in his inmost soul deceit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He through the nightly darkness took his way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From high Olympus, glowing with the love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of her, the fair-one of the graceful zone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swift to the Typhaonian mount he pass’d:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thence drew nigh Phycium’s lofty ridge: sublime</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There sitting, the wise counsellor of heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Revolved a work divine. That self-same night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He sought the couch of her, who stately treads</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With long-paced step; and melting in her arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Took there his fill of love. That self-same night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The host-arousing chief, the mighty deed</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Nor to the vassals and the shepherd hinds</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">His footstep bent, before he climb’d the couch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of his Alcmena: such inflaming love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seiz’d in the deep recesses of his heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The chief of thousands. And as he, that scarce</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Escapes, and yet escapes, from grievous plague</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or the hard-fettering chain, flies free away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Joyful,—so struggling through that arduous toil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With pain accomplish’d, wishful, eager, traced</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The prince his homeward way. The live-long night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He with the modest partner of his bed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Embracing lay, and revell’d in delight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bounteous bliss of love’s all-charming queen.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thus by a god and by the first of men</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alike subdued to love, Alcmena gave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Twin-brethren birth, within the seven-fold gates</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Thebes: yet brethren though they were, unlike</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their natures: this of weaker strain; but that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Far more of man; valorous and stern and strong.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Him, Hercules, conceived she from th’ embrace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the cloud-darkener: to th’ Alcæan chief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shaker of spears, gave Iphiclus: a race</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Distinct: nor wonder: this of mortal man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That of imperial Jove. The same who slew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The lofty-minded Cygnus, child of Mars.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
    <div class="verse indent2">For in the grove of the far-darting god</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He found him: and insatiable of war</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His father Mars beside. Both bright in arms,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bright as the sheen of burning flame, they stood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On their high chariot; and the horses fleet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trampled the ground with rending hoofs: around</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In parted circle smoked the cloudy dust,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Up-dash’d beneath the trampling hoofs, and cars</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of complicated frame. The well-framed cars</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rattled aloud: loud clash’d the wheels: while rapt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In their full speed the horses flew. Rejoiced</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The noble Cygnus; for the hope was his,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jove’s warlike offspring and his charioteer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To slay, and strip them of their gorgeous mail.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But to his vows the Prophet-god of day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turn’d a deaf ear: for he himself set on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ assault of Hercules. Now all the grove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Phœbus’ altar, flash’d with glimmering arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of that tremendous god: himself blazed light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And darted radiance from his eye-balls glared</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As it were flame. But who of mortal mould</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had e’er endured in daring opposite</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To rush before him, save but Hercules,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Ioläus, an illustrious name?</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">For mighty strength was theirs: and arms that stretch’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From their broad shoulders unapproachable</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In valorous force, above their nervous frames:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He therefore thus bespoke his charioteer:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“Oh hero Ioläus! dearest far</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To me of all the race of mortal men;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I deem it sure that ’gainst the blest of Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amphitryon sinn’d, when to the fair-wall’d Thebes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He came, forsaking Tirynth’s well-built walls,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Electryon midst the strife of wide-brow’d herds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Slain by his hand: to Creon suppliant came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And her of flowing robe, Henioche:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who straight embraced, and all of needful aid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lent hospitable, as to suppliant due:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And more for this, e’en from the heart they gave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All honour and observance. So he lived,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exulting in his graceful-ankled spouse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alcmena. When the rapid year roll’d round,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We, far unlike in stature and in soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were born, thy sire and I: him Jove bereaved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of wisdom; who from his parental home</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Went forth, and to the fell Eurystheus bore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His homage. Wretch! for he most sure bewail’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In after-time that grievous fault, a deed</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Irrevocable. On myself has Fate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laid heavy labours. But, oh friend! oh now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quick snatch the purple reins of these my steeds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rapid of hoof: the manly courage rouse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Within thee: now with strong unerring grasp</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Guide the swift chariot’s whirl, and wind the steeds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rapid of hoof: fear nought the dismal yell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of mortal-slayer Mars, whilst to and fro</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He ranges fierce Apollo’s hallow’d grove</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With frenzying shout: for, be he as he may</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">War-mighty, he of war shall take his fill.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Then answer’d Ioläus: “Oh revered!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Doubtless the father of the gods and men</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy head delights to honour; and the god</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who keeps <a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>the wall of Thebes and guards her towers,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Unto thy hand this mortal huge and strong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That from the conflict thou mayst bear away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High glory. But now haste—in warlike mail</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dress now thy limbs, that, rapidly as thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mingling the shock of cars, we may be join’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In battle. He th’ undaunted son of Jove</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall strike not with his terrors, nor yet me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Iphiclides: but swiftly, as I deem,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall he to flight betake him, from the race</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of brave Alcæus: who now pressing nigh</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gain on their foes and languish for the shout</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of closing combat; to their eager ear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More grateful than the banquet’s revelry.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He said: and Hercules smiled stern his joy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Elate of thought: for he had spoken words</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Most welcome. Then with winged accents thus:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Jove-foster’d hero! it is e’en at hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The battle’s rough encounter: thou, as erst,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">In martial prudence firm, aright, aleft,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With vantage of the fray, unerring guide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Arion huge, the sable-maned, and me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aid in the doubtful contest, as thou mayst.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thus having said, he sheathed his legs in greaves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of mountain brass, resplendent-white: famed gift</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Vulcan: o’er his breast he fitted close</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The corselet, variegated, beautiful,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of shining gold; this Jove-born Pallas gave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When first he rush’d to meet the mingling groans</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of battle. Then the mighty man athwart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His shoulder slung the sword, whose edge repels</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ approach of mortal harms: and clasp’d around</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His bosom, and reclining o’er his back,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He cast the hollow quiver. Lurk’d therein</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full many arrows: shuddering horror they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inflicted, and the agony of death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sudden, that chokes the suffocated voice:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The points were barb’d with death, and bitter steep’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In human tears: burnish’d the lengthening shafts:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they were feather’d from the tawny plume</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of eagles. Now he grasp’d the solid spear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sharpen’d with brass: and on his brows of strength</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Placed the forged helm, high-wrought in adamant,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">That cased the temples round, and fenced the head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Hercules: the man of heavenly birth.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Then with his hands he raised <span class="smcap">The Shield</span>, of disk</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Diversified: might none with missile aim</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pierce, nor th’ impenetrable substance rive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shattering: a wondrous frame: since all throughout</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bright with enamel, and with ivory,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Refulgent, and with azure plates inlaid.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The scaly terror of a dragon coil’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full in the central field; unspeakable;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With eyes oblique retorted, that aslant</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Dispersedly with jagged fangs of white,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The dragon’s forehead fell, stern Strife in air</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hung hovering, and array’d the war of men:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Haggard; whose aspect from all mortals reft</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Below this earth their spirits to th’ abyss</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath the parching sun, their whitening bones</div>

    <div class="verse indent0"><a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>Pursuit was there, and fiercely rallying Flight,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">A sound was heard. Such miracles display’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The buckler’s field, with living blazonry</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">A branch of Mars, and Theseus like a god:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Son of Ægéus: silver were their limbs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their armour golden: and to them opposed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Centaur band stood thronging: Asbolus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prophet of birds; Petræus huge of height;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Arctus, and Urius, and of raven locks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mimas; the two Peucidæ, Dryalus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Perimedes: all of silver frame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And grasping golden pine-trees in their hands.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At once they onset made: in very life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They rush’d, and hand to hand tumultuous closed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With pines and clashing spears. There fleet of hoof</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The steeds were standing of stern-visaged Mars</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In gold: and he himself, tearer of spoils,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Life-waster, purpled all with dropping blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As one who slew the living and despoil’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Loud-shouting to the warrior-infantry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There vaulted on his chariot. Him beside</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stood Fear and Consternation: high their hearts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Panted, all eager for the war of men.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">There too Minerva rose, leader of hosts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Resembling Pallas when she would array</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The marshall’d battle. In her grasp the spear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on her brows a golden helm: athwart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her shoulders thrown her ægis. Went she forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In this array to meet the dreadful shout</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of war. And there a tuneful choir appear’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of heaven’s immortals: in the midst the son</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Jove and of Latona sweetly rang</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon his golden harp. Th’ Olympian mount,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dwelling of gods, thrill’d back the broken sound.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there were seen th’ assembly of the gods</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Listening, encircled with their blaze of glory:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in sweet contest with Apollo there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The virgins of Pieria raised the strain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Preluding; and they seem’d as though they sang</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">With clear sonorous voice. And there appear’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sheltering haven from the untamed rage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of ocean. It was wrought of tin refined,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And rounded by the chisel: and it seem’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like to the dashing wave: and in the midst</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full many dolphins chased the fry, and show’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As though they swam the waters, to and fro</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Darting tumultuous. Two of silver scale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Panting above the wave, the fishes mute</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gorged, that beneath them shook their quivering fins</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In brass: but on the crag a fisher sate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Observant: in his grasp he held a net,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like one that, poising, rises to the throw.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">There was the horseman, fair-hair’d Danaë’s son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perseus: nor yet the buckler with his feet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Touch’d, nor yet distant hover’d: strange to think:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For nowhere on the surface of the shield</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He rested: so the crippled artist-god</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Illustrious framed him with his hands in gold.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bound to his feet were sandals wing’d: a sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of brass with hilt of sable ebony</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hung round him from the shoulders by a thong:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swift e’en as thought he flew. The visage grim</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of monstrous Gorgon all his back o’erspread:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wrought in silver, wondrous to behold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A veil was drawn around it, whence in gold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hung glittering fringes: and the dreadful helm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Pluto clasp’d the temples of the prince,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shedding a night of darkness. Thus outstretch’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In air, he seem’d like one to trembling flight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Betaken. Close behind the Gorgons twain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of nameless terror unapproachable</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came rushing: eagerly they stretch’d their arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To seize him: from the pallid adamant,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Audibly as they rush’d, the clattering shield</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clank’d with a sharp shrill sound. Two grisly snakes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hung from their girdles, and with forking tongues</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lick’d their inflected jaws; and violent gnash’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their fangs fell glaring: from around their heads</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those Gorgons grim a flickering horror cast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through the wide air. Above them warrior men</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Waged battle, grasping weapons in their hands.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>Some from their city and their sires repell’d</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Destruction: others hasten’d to destroy:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And many press’d the plain, but more still held</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The combat. On the strong-constructed towers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stood women, shrieking shrill, and rent their cheeks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In very life, by Vulcan’s glorious craft.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The elders hoar with age assembled stood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Without the gates, and to the blessed gods</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their hands uplifted, for their fighting sons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fear-stricken. These again the combat held.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Behind them stood the Fates, of aspect black,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grim, slaughter-breathing, stern, insatiable,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gnashing their white fangs; and fierce conflict held</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For those who fell. Each eager-thirsting sought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To quaff the sable blood. Whom first they snatch’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prostrate, or staggering with the fresh-made wound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On him they struck their talons huge: the soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fled down th’ abyss, the horror-freezing gulf</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Tartarus. They, glutted to the heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With human gore, behind them cast the corse:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And back with hurrying rage they turn’d to seek</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The throng of battle. And hard by there stood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clotho and Lachesis; and Atropos,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Somewhat in years inferior: nor was she</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A mighty goddess: yet those other Fates</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Transcending, and in birth the elder far.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all around one man in cruel strife</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were join’d: and on each other turn’d in wrath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their glowing eyes: and mingling desperate hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And talons mutual strove. <a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>And near to them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stood Misery: wan, ghastly, worn with woe:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Arid, and swoln of knees; with hunger’s pains</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Faint-falling: from her lean hands long the nails</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Out-grew: an ichor from her nostrils flow’d:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blood from her cheeks distill’d to earth: with teeth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All wide disclosed in grinning agony</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She stood: a cloud of dust her shoulders spread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And her eyes ran with tears. But next arose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>A well-tower’d city, by seven golden gates</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enclosed, that fitted to their lintels hung:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There men in dances and in festive joys</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Held revelry. Some on the smooth-wheel’d car</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A virgin bride conducted: then burst forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aloud the marriage-song: and far and wide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long splendours flash’d from many a quivering torch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Borne in the hands of slaves. Gay-blooming girls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Preceded, and the dancers follow’d blithe:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These with shrill pipe indenting the soft lip</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Breathed melody, while broken echoes thrill’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Around them: to the lyre with flying touch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those led the love-enkindling dance. A group</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of youths was elsewhere imaged to the flute</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Disporting: some in dances and in song,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In laughter others. To the minstrel’s flute</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So pass’d they on; and the whole city seem’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As fill’d with pomps, with dances, and with feasts.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Others again, without the city walls,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0"><a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>Vaulted on steeds and madden’d for the goal.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>Others as husbandmen appear’d, and broke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With coulter the rich glebe, and gather’d up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their tunics neatly girded. Next arose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A field thick-set with depth of corn: where some</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With sickle reap’d the stalks, their speary heads</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bent, as weigh’d down with pods of swelling grain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fruits of Ceres. Others into bands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gather’d, and threw upon the threshing-floor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sheaves. And some again hard by were seen</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Holding the vine-sickle, who clusters cut</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the ripe vines; which from the vintagers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Others in frails received, or bore away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>In baskets thus up-piled, the cluster’d grapes,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Of spreading vines, whose tendrils curling twined</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In silver, heavy-foliaged: near them rose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ranks of vines, by Vulcan’s curious craft</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Figured in gold. The vines leaf-shaking curl’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Round silver props. They therefore on their way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pass’d jocund to one minstrel’s flageolet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Burthen’d with grapes that blacken’d in the sun.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some also trod the wine-press, and some quaff’d</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The foaming must. But in another part</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were men who wrestled, or in gymnic fight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wielded the cæstus. Elsewhere men of chase</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were taking the fleet hares. Two keen-tooth’d dogs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bounded beside: these ardent in pursuit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those with like ardour doubling on their flight.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Next them were horsemen, who sore effort made</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To win the prize of contest and hard toil.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High o’er the well-compacted chariots <a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>hung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The charioteers: the rapid horses loosed</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">At their full stretch, and shook the floating reins.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rebounding from the ground with many a shock</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flew clattering the firm cars, and creak’d aloud</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The naves of the round wheels. They therefore toil’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Endless: nor conquest yet at any time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Achiev’d they, but a doubtful strife maintain’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the mid-course the prize, a tripod huge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was placed in open sight; and it was carved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In gold: the skilful Vulcan’s glorious craft.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Rounding the uttermost verge <a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>the ocean flow’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As in full swell of waters: and the shield</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All-variegated with whole circle bound.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swans of high-hovering wing there clamour’d shrill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And many skimm’d the breasted surge: and nigh</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fishes were tossing in tumultuous leaps.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sight marvellous e’en to thundering Jove: whose will</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bade Vulcan frame the buckler; vast and strong.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This fitting to his grasp the strong-nerved son</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Jupiter now shook with ease: and swift</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As from his father’s ægis-wielding arm</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Above the harness’d chariot at a bound</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Stood o’er the steeds from high, and guided strong</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The crooked car. Now near to them approach’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pallas, the blue-eyed goddess, and address’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These winged words in animating voice:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>“Race of the far-famed Lyngeus! both all-hail!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Cygnus your foe, and strip his gorgeous arms.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But I will breathe a word within thine ear</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Thus having said, the goddess all-divine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aye holding in her everlasting hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Conquest and glory, rose into the car</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Impetuous: to the war-steeds shouted fierce</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The noble Ioläus: from the shout</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They starting snatch’d the flying car, and hid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With dusty cloud the plain: for she herself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The goddess azure-eyed, sent into them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wild courage, clashing on her brandish’d shield:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Earth groan’d around. That moment with like pace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E’en as a flame or tempest came they on,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">We wage the battle: and e’en this I say</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That elsewhere, heretofore, himself has proved</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">He stood: but thrice, when stricken by my lance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Earth propp’d his fall, and thrice his targe was cleft:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fourth time urging on my utmost force</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His ample shield I shattering rived, his thigh</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Transpierced, and headlong in the dust he fell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath my rushing spear: so there the weight</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Then truly from their close-compacted cars</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Instant as thought they leap’d to earth: the son</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Aside, though not remote, the charioteers</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Leap with a bound, and o’er each other whirl’d</div>

beautiful, Ethics, iv. 7. Xenophon in his Cyropædia, ii. 5, describes
the beautiful Panthea as “of surpassing height and
vigour.” Theocritus mentions a fulness of form as equally characteristic
of beauty:</p>

<p>I am satisfied
that this is to be taken in a literal, not in a metaphysical or
poetic sense. Nearly all the Greek female epithets had a reference
to some artificial mode of heightening the personal allurements:
as <i>rosy-fingered</i>; <i>rosy-elbowed</i>: I think κυανεαων, <i>black</i>,
is an epithet of the same cast: and alludes to the darkening of
the eye-lid by the rim drawn round it with a needle dipped in
antimonial oil. “The eye-lashes breathing of Venus,” has a
palpable connexion with this. Athenæus, xv. describes the several
unguents for the hair, breast, and arms, which were in use
among the Greeks, as impregnated with the odour of rose,
myrtle, or crocus. The oily dye employed by the women to
blacken their eye-brows and eye-lashes was doubtless perfumed
in the same manner. Virgil probably had in his mind the perfumed
hair of a Roman lady, when he described the tresses of
Venus breathing ambrosia, Æn. i. 402:</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_254" href="#FNanchor_254" class="label">[254]</a> <i>Those herds, the cause of strife.</i>] The story commonly runs,
that the Taphians, and Teloboans, a lawless and piratical people,
had made an inroad into the territory of Argos, and carried off
Electryon’s herds: that in the pursuit a battle took place, and the
robbers killed the brothers of Alcmena: and Amphitryon himself
accidentally killed Electryon. But it should appear from
Hesiod that he killed him by design on some provocation or
dispute.</p>

sacred writer. Many colonies that went abroad styled themselves
Thebeans, in reference to the ark: as the memory of the
deluge was held very sacred. Hence there occur many cities of
the name of Theba, not in Ægypt only and Bœotia, but in
Cilicia, Ionia, Attica, &amp;c. It was sometimes expressed Thiba;
a town of which name was in Pontus: it is called Thibis by
Pliny; and he mentions a notion which prevailed, that the people
of this place could not sink in water. <span class="smcap">Bryant.</span></p>

<p>Warton observes,
History of English poetry, vol. i. p. 468: “The French and
Italian poets, whom Chaucer imitates, abound in allegorical
personages: and it is remarkable that the early poets of Greece
and Rome were fond of these creations: we have in Hesiod
‘Darkness:’ and many others; if the Shield of Hercules be of
his hand.” But it seems to have escaped the writer that it is not
literal, but figurative Darkness which is personified. Guietus
ingeniously supposes that it is meant for the dimness of death.
Homer, indeed, applies to this the same term: in the death of
Eurymachus, Od. xxii. 88:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Κατ’ οφθαλμων δ’ εχυτ’ ΑΧΛΥΣ.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A darkening mist was pour’d upon his eyes.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tanaquil Faber, on Longinus, contends that αχλυς is here
Sorrow. Sorrow is personified in a fragment of Ennius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Omnibus endo locis ingens apparet imago</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tristitia.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sorrow, a giant form, uprears the head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In every place.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is adopted by Grævius and Robinson. In like manner
φως its opposite, light, is often used for χαρα, joy: as appears in
the oriental style of scripture. But they have omitted to notice
that this is a <i>specific</i> sorrow: for what connexion have these
horrible symptoms with sorrow in general? I conceive that the
prosopopœia describes the misery attendant on war: and especially
in a city besieged, with its usual accompaniments of famine,
blood, and tears, and the dust or ashes of mourning. Longinus
selects the line “an ichor from her nostrils flowed,” as an instance
of the false sublime; and compares it with Homer’s verse
on Discord,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Treading on earth, her forehead touches heaven.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is to compare two things totally unlike: why should an
image of exhaustion and disease be thought to aim at sublimity?
The objection of Longinus that it tends to excite disgust rather
than terror is nugatory. The poet did not intend to excite terror,
but horror: that kind of horror which arises from the contemplation
of physical suffering.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_264" href="#FNanchor_264" class="label">[264]</a> <i>Vaulted on steeds.</i>] This circumstance has been thought to
betray a later age: as it is alleged, that the only instance of
riding on horseback mentioned by Homer is that of Diomed, who,
with Ulysses, rides the horses of Rhesus of which he has made
prize. But though chariot-horses only are found in the Homeric
battles, there is an allusion to horsemanship, as an exhibition of
skill, in a simile of the 15th book of the Iliad, v. 679; where the
rider is described as riding four horses at once, and vaulting from
one to the other.</p>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE.</h3>

<p>George Chapman was born in 1557. Wood, in
the Athenæ Oxonienses, imagines that he was a sworn
servant either to James the First or his queen; and
says that he was highly valued; but not so much as
Ben Jonson: “a person of most reverend aspect,
religious and temperate, qualities rarely meeting in a
poet.” After living to the age of 77 years he died
on the 12th day of May 1634, in the parish of St.
Giles’s in the Fields, and was buried there on the
south side of the church-yard. His friend Inigo
Jones erected a monument to his memory. Of his<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>translation of Homer, Dryden tells us that Waller
used to say he never could read it without incredible
transport. Besides other translations and poems, he
was the author of 17 dramatic pieces.—See <i>Dodsley’s
Collections of Old Plays</i>, vol. iv.</p>

<p>His version of “The Georgicks of Hesiod” is inscribed
in an <i>Epistle Dedicatorie</i> to “The most noble
Combiner of Learning and Honour Sir Francis Bacon,
Knight; Lord High Chancellor of England, &amp;c.”
and prefixed are two copies of commendatory verses
with the signatures of Michael Drayton, and Ben
Jonson.</p>

<p>This version is generally faithful both to the sense
and spirit of the author. Amidst much quaintness
of style and ruggedness of numbers, we meet with
gleams of a rich expression and with a grasp of language,
which, however extravagantly bold, bears the
stamp of a genuine poet. Cooke had probably not
seen this translation, or he must have avoided many
of the errors into which he fell.</p>

<h4>FOOTNOTES</h4>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_279" href="#FNanchor_279" class="label">[279]</a> Granger, in his biographical history of England, speaks
slightingly of Chapman’s Homer on Pope’s authority. Pope singularly
explains what he considers as the defects of this translation,
by saying that “the nature of the man may account for
his whole performance: as he appears to have been of an arrogant
turn, and <i>an enthusiast in poetry</i>.” A strange disqualification!
He confesses, also, that “what very much contributed to
cover his defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation:
which is something like what one might imagine Homer
himself would have written before he arrived at years of discretion.”
<span class="smcap">Preface to Homer.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Godwin, in his “Lives of Edward and John Philips, nephews
of Milton,” has illustrated the natural energy of style in
Chapman’s Homer with critical taste and just feeling. Chap. x.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
